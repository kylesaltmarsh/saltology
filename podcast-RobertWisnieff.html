                        <h1>Dr. Robert Wisnieff &mdash; CTO Quantum Computing, IBM Research</h1>


                        <p>Quantum computing was easily the most exciting thing for me at the THINK 2019 conference. My
                            excitement for the advances in quantum was topped only by getting the chance interview IBM's
                            Chief Technology Officer for Quantum Computing, Dr. Robert Wisnieff. Or just Bob, as he
                            prefers. Sounds a far less intimidating. Bob was an integral member of the team who invented
                            the very first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad"
                                target=&quot;_blank&quot>ThinkPad</a>! He has truly seen first hand the transformative
                            process that IBM has undergone from hardware to software. Bob is now CTO in - as far as I am
                            concerned - the most exciting field in technology today. You can really hear the passion in
                            his voice and I found myself feeling the exact same way during this interview. Bob is the
                            embodiment of saying "Do what you love and love what you do". Enjoy the podcast!</p>

                                        To get this right and I may have went through your LinkedIn, you first graduated
                                        from Yale?</div>

                                        Research, based in Yorktown Heights, New York. Going back to when you were
                                        studying, what made you decide that you wanted to do a PhD?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So it was in solid state physics. So this is the route I
                                        started in 1980, getting my PhD and I wanted to do something in microelectronics
                                        and solid state physics. And my thought was that at that time there were no cell
                                        phones. Microelectronics was a far less capable thing and you could see that if
                                        microelectronics could continue improving on what the first steps showed that it
                                        would be transformative. And so I thought that would be a fun thing to do and
                                        work in. So I worked on making very small CMOS<a href="#"

                                        devices for my thesis and actually the goal of it was to show quantisation
                                        effects of low temperature inside the CMOS devices to look at the transport. And
                                        they came to work at IBM and found this little group of people that had it as
                                        their mission that, see the IBM PC had just come out. It was the old box on top
                                        of the desk and so there was a group and research that was saying “well that's
                                        that's not the future, it's not that box on the desk, it’s gonna be a tablet”.
                                        And we had these little pieces of plastic that we had taped pictures too and we
                                        said “this is what a tablet of the future is going to be like”. And it was
                                        basically an iPad</div>

                                    <div class="message from">So we thought it's gonna be liquid crystal and it's gotta
                                        have transistors all over it. So we need to figure out how to make those
                                        transistors and make the displays and we did research, we made little tiny ones
                                        and we then convinced the company to do a joint venture with Toshiba. We did
                                        manufacturing in Japan and by the early 90s we were shipping stuff. It was it
                                        was an amazing ride</div>

                                    <div class="message from">Increasingly I think that I don’t tend to do pure
                                        research. I do very much applied research<a href="#" class="footnote2-button"
                                            data-footnote2-identifier=“3” alt="See Footnote2 3” rel=" footnote2"
                                            data-footnote2-content="<p>Pure research (also known as “basic” or “fundamental” research) is exploratory in nature and is conducted without any practical end-use in mind. It is driven by gut instinct, interest, curiosity or intuition, and simply aims to advance knowledge and to identify/explain relationships between variables. However, as the term “fundamental” suggests, pure research may provide a foundation for further, sometimes applied research.

                                                    In general, applied research is not carried out for its own sake but in order to solve specific, practical questions or problems. It tends to be descriptive, rather than exploratory and is often based upon pure research. However, the distinction between applied and pure research may sometimes be unclear; for example, is research into the genetic codes of plants being carried out simply to advance knowledge or for possible future commercial exploitation? It could be argued that the only real difference between these two categories of research is the length of time between research and reasonably foreseeable practical applications, either in the public or private sectors.</p>"><span>3</span></a>.
                                        So there's this sort of continuum between pure research to applied research to
                                        development to product development and I think I've worked across most of that
                                        spectrum over the years and it's fun to be able to follow the project through
                                        the layers as it matures. Because what what you think you're doing when you
                                        start the project and what you wind up doing at the end tend to be very
                                        different. I mean we we started out making tablets, we were sure that that had
                                        to be the future, had to be a tablet, maybe with a pen. And the think-pad came
                                        out, this notebook computer with a keyboard because whenever we would do tests
                                        with people they would say I can't do this without a keyboard. haha, I’m not
                                        touching it</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Haha wow</div>
                                    <div class="message from">And so the early notebooks all had keyboards. Yeah and
                                        once that started the OSs were written to it the GUIs were written to it and it
                                        took many many many tries on apples part to find the right combination to make a
                                        tablet a success. So if you look in history throughout the 90s there were many
                                        attempts at tablets and all of them absolute disasters</div>

                                    <div class="message from">So I in the late 90s I did a study for Lou Gerstner and
                                        the question that was asked by the board was “what will happen over the next 10
                                        years with flat panel displays?”. Because it had grown from notebooks to
                                        desktops and things over the course of the 90s and they were wondering what came
                                        next and we came back and said “by 2005 a 1 meter diagonal HDTV will sell for

To date, researchers simply aren’t there yet. Since qubits have multiple possible states, their combined computational ability scales exponentially as you add more of them. This means they become lousy with errors once they’re operating with just a handful of qubits. Unfortunately we need a lot of qubits to do anything useful with a quantum computer.

                                        effectively impossible by any other means. And so you have to estimate well how
                                        long will it take us to get to that kind of capability? And we'll get there over

                                        it's instructive to us to do that because in general we know a lot of the

                                        I wanted time to freeze. Because It was the first time that I could see that

                        <p>Here are my key takeaways from the podcast.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Everybody should strive to change the lives of others</b> - Obviously Bob's ability
                                to change the world and lives of others may not be shared by everyone, but I agree that
                                we can all strive to positively impact others, even if it is simply just our friends and
                                family</li>
                            <li> <b>Don't be afraid and make bold moves</b> - Bob believes that it is much better to
                                face failure and recovery than to face the thought "I really should have". Fear is
                                temporary, regret is permanent</li>
                            <li> <b>Quantum computing will transform everything as computers did</b> - Bob strongly
                                believes that quantum computing will be at least - if not more - transformative than the
                                original computers were and that it is about 5-ish years away</li>
                            <li> <b>Get involved with quantum through the Q Network</b> - The Q Network is an online
                                community that helps the IBM Q team in pushing forward the movement of quantum
                                computing. Anyone can keep up to date and have access to IBM's online quantum computer
