                        <h1>Russel Potapinski &mdash; Living Life Differently, Pemberton</h1>

                        <p>
                            I first met Russ in my first ever summer vacation placement in data science at Woodside
                            Energy. Russ was the head of cognitive science at the time and his passion and visionary
                            approach set me on a path to chase my dreams and pursue a career in technology. I then
                            came to work in the Intelligent and Autonomous Systems team as a robotics engineer which was
                            the most rewarding and
                            fulfilling experience of my career to date. Russ has had an illustrious career that spans
                            from
                            engineering to working in mergers and acquisitions to artificial intelligence to robotics
                            forming
                            Australia's first space act agreement with NASA to founding his own company AROSE to advance
                            Australia's
                            remote operations capability for space and Earth to now happily retired with his lovely wife
                            Tina in the great South West, Pemberton.
                            Russ is the epitome of "its not what you do, but how you do it".
                            The only thing more powerful than Russ's resume of accomplishments is the life changing
                            positive impact he has had on so many people.
                            Russ has been my leader, my mentor and is now a close friend. Enjoy the podcast!

                            notes. I have also included some of the raw speech-to-text bloopers which are by far greater
                            than the real content itself. These footnotes are slightly more boring <a href="#"

                                        interviewing Russell Potapinski, who's had a very multifaceted career, ranging
                                        from reservoir engineering to mergers and acquisitions, to leading an AI team,
                                        leading the intelligent and autonomous systems team, and now living life
                                        differently in Pemberton, in a well-deserved retirement. I'll kick us off with
                                        an icebreaker. I thought I might abe able to guess these, but I thought if you
                                        could let us know what your favorite food was, your favorite hobby and your
                                        favorite movie.
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">All right, Kyle, thanks. It's a pleasure being on
                                        saltology and yes, welcome to my lovely home here in Pemberton, Western
                                        Australia. Favorite food. It would probably be a genre of foods. Curries. I love
                                        all curries, Indian, Thai, Malaysian. So that would definitely be my favorite
                                        food. Even better when I get to cook them with Tina. We love cooking together,
                                        so that would be definitely that that camp in terms of favorite hobbies,
                                        probably hiking, really enjoy that. Of course, we're in the beautiful southern
                                        forest, so it's right outside the back doors. Probably equal to that would be
                                        kayakin, I Kayak with one of my mates on the Black Wood River quite a bit. So we
                                        love that as well. In terms of favorite movie, I'm usually a sci fi fantasy
                                        genre</div>
                                    <div class="message to">I had Star Trek</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, Star Treks are up there. Obviously have
                                        Star Wars are up there. The Marvel series I thought you were really, really good
                                        as well. So yeah, I'll just sort of that's the sort of overall genre rather than
                                        a specific movie </div>
                                    <div class="message to">I think I had you I would have guessed your hobby
                                        is potentially gaming</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yes, I do do a lot of gaming, probably a little
                                        bit less than I thought I would in retirement. But yes, certainly all the way
                                        back to the World of Warcraft days. Yeah, yeah definitely love loving all that
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">And had wine but maybe more is your food, but not
                                        necessarily a hobby. But it could also be</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Oh yeah, yeah. No, definitely. Definitely enjoy
                                        the wine. Course. You know, we're in an amazing wine region. The winery right
                                        here where the Chardonnay Pinot Noir is in particular</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So you have had a very interesting and a very
                                        varied career as per the intro, lots of different experience in lots of
                                        different fields. I'd like to, if we could, take a trip down memory lane. Start
                                        where it all began back in your your homeland of Canada. Would you have be able
                                        to tell us, what you did at university, what led you to choose to study what you
                                        did? And then how that ended up taking you to be in Perth all the way from
                                        Canada</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Right so I ended up studying mechanical
                                        engineering. The reason that I actually applied and got accepted for engineering
                                        is it was one of the lowest averages to get in, which sounds weird, but in
                                        Canada they learned very quickly that your high school marks didn't correlate to
                                        whether you'd be able to finish an engineering degree or not. Yeah, which is
                                        kind of interesting. My passion was always to have a career in the military. I
                                        was lucky enough to get accepted for the officer training program in the
                                        Canadian Armed Forces, accepted there they're into the artillery branch.
                                        However, about a week before we finished our general training boot camp, if you
                                        will, you know, if you think of it that way, I had an asthma attack and the
                                        doctor, unfortunately, on the base, even though I'd been cleared by the previous
                                        doctor, didn't think that asthmatics had a place in the military. And so I was
                                        honorably discharged that day, which was a horrible day in my life. But on the
                                        upside, I still had a opening at a civilian university. So I had applied at the
                                        University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. And basically the military in Canada
                                        uses the civilian university system to basically do their academic
                                        qualifications. So just show them you've got accepted at a Canadian university,
                                        and that's the academic tick for the officer training program. So I didn't I
                                        didn't actually turn down that offer. I just kept it as a live option. So when I
                                        ended my career at the military, I had an opening for engineering and I didn't
                                        have any better idea. So I thought, why not?

                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, well during university we've got our
                                        summer breaks there and my original plan was to get into the defense companies
                                        like the Boeings. The Raytheon's, however, was looking for summer jobs and it
                                        was with these old rolled recipe cards. This was sort of days before the
                                        bulletin board and, you know, Internet hadn't really taken off. And I looked in
                                        Esso, which is Exxon in Canada had a opening for field operator. So driving
                                        around and making sure the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Dpd52pfp0" target=&quot;_blank&quot> nodding donkey</a> is going up and down. But what really
                                        sort of took me back from that was the pay. So I called my dad, who owned a farm
                                        supply shop before retired in rural Canada and told them, look, this is what
                                        they're offering for three and a half months work and he said well I have never
                                        earnt that in a year. So I quickly changed my plans into the energy sector and
                                        then I got to job with Shell Canada after university, which was, which was
                                        great. And how I kind of came to, to Australia. They at the time Shell actually
                                        had their training center in the Netherlands, in Holland called Lord Viker Holt,
                                        and it was a global training center at the time. Woodside would also send its
                                        staff there. And so I actually met a I was on a reservoir engineering course and
                                        a drilling engineer was on the drilling101 course. Her and I got along really
                                        well together. And coincidentally when I flew back to Calgary, I had a job offer
                                        in my inbox waiting for me from a consulting company in Perth</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And it was a coincidence</div>
                                    <div class="message from">It was absolutely a coincidence, yeah. Because
                                        at the time Shell used a very specific reservoir simulation program that was
                                        bespoke to Shell. And I was one of the few people in the world that knew how to
                                        program in that, in that language for that simulation package. And so quite in
                                        demand, unbeknownst to me at the time. And so I'd never heard of that company.
                                        So they gave me a job offer to move to Perth and be a consultant into Woodside
                                        because they use shell software. And so kind of those two events completely
                                        coincidental. Well clearly fate has spoken and so yeah I put together a backpack
                                        and sold all my stuff and moved to Australia</div>
                                    <div class="message to">I think you told me this. So the contract was
                                        only six months right?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Originally a six month contract. Yeah. And I
                                        ended up working for this consulting company for two years and then Woodside
                                        gave me an offer. It was interesting. I somehow got asked by our mergers and
                                        acquisitions team. It was because I actually had knowledge of carbonate
                                        reservoirs which were in Canada, but very little carbonate reservoirs here in
                                        Australia, certainly Western Australia. And Woodside's mergers and acquisitions
                                        team, we're looking at taking over a gas asset in the Philippines and I had
                                        knowledge of those types of reservoirs. So I got asked to pack my bags and join
                                        the mergers and acquisitions team as a due diligence, subsurface due diligence
                                        expert, and that lasted for many years. We were also in the Gulf of Mexico, but
                                        they didn't have anybody with oil trading experience on the mergers and
                                        acquisitions team. And yet we needed to know with different sulfur contents how
                                        I was going get marketing into the pipelines and all that process. And so I just
                                        learned actually a head of BHP marketing in Houston was very kind enough and she
                                        taught me how that system worked. And so during the whole due diligence exercise
                                        I became a little bit of an expert in oil marketing in the United States. And so
                                        after when that deal concluded or failed to conclude actually, the main oil
                                        marketing team offered me a job full time. It was a seondment from reservoir
                                        engineering into oil marketing trading at Woodside. Yeah, yeah. And so then the
                                        mergers and acquisitions team loved me then because I was actually a two for one
                                        deal, like having only one person to fly around the world to do due diligence.
                                        But I could do it on behalf of the, you know, the downstream marketing and
                                        trading and what could we get for these oil, you know, these blends or the gas
                                        markets and also the subsurface. And so that led to a full time career with
                                        mergers and acquisitions. So actually being the the person that coordinated the
                                        multiple aspects of the deal from the financial statements, the financial
                                        modeling, the environmental due diligence, the legal forms of the mergers and
                                        acquisitions. So managing that team that would put that together and then put
                                        together papers and transaction books for our board of directors to consider.
                                        And so I had my first board meeting on my 30th birthday. So it was kind of a,
                                        you know, a rapid learning curve, that's what, so to speak</div>
                                    <div class="message to">That's awesome. And how long did you stay in
                                        mergers and acquisitions?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. Stayed in mergers and acquisitions and a
                                        combination of that and then strategic roles for about four or five years before
                                        then moving into more asset management or profit and loss of groups. So I was
                                        the business manager for all of the Australian oil at the time we called it, but
                                        it was all in non LNG, so all the FPSOs and onshore. And so I would manage the
                                        business aspects of all that, the business decision making of all of that. So
                                        some more, definitely more profit and loss oriented. And then after that, it
                                        became the same role having all the commercial marketing governance strategy
                                        teams report and I was part of Pluto and Pluto business unit. And so
                                        yeah, that was, that was sort of my career at that point. And then my wife
                                        decided to retire from Woodside at the end of 2013 and I asked for and Peter
                                        Coleman our CEO at the time was quite gracious and allowed me to take a year's
                                        leave without pay so we could live down here in Pemberton, get trained up as
                                        firefighters, host my family down here, all of that sort of stuff. And as Tina
                                        transitioned to the next stage of her retirement</div>

                                    <div class="message to">Before you took that year off that varied
                                        experience you'd have had up until then was that something that you pushed for
                                        or you just sort of going with the flow? Was it a deliberate or an emergent
                                        strategy?</div>

                                    <div class="message from">Look, I think it was in the beginning was
                                        definitely an emergent strategy. But I found out that I really loved the
                                        diversity of problems that I would get in those sorts of roles. So it's not like
                                        a deep technical role, but, you know, in 30 minute increments during your day,
                                        you'd be negotiating, you know, particular thing with governments or community
                                        groups that may have been impacted. Or then in a business decision, the
                                        reservoir engineer is one of the drilling engineers to keep drilling but the
                                        drilling engineer say well we run the risk of the borehole collapse and so
                                        navigating all those complex business decisions I really liked. And sort of
                                        during that era also under Don Voelte, I got to got the tag of the the Mr. Fix it
                                        person and would get you know I used to richard Goyder as Mr. Fixit or anything
                                        like that so a lot of these various problems that didn't fit into any nice
                                        category, I remember one of the big ones is the Premier of Western Australia,
                                        Mr. Carpenter and Don Volte. He got into a quite a public stoush over domestic
                                        gas at Pluto. And of course then the Premier said, well to break this? He
                                        appointed Jim Limerick, who's the head of the Department of Mines and Petroleum
                                        at the time. And Don picked me and we had to jointly come up with a solution
                                        that would actually satisfy Woodside, it would make still make the project
                                        economic go ahead and contributed massively to the economy, but then protected
                                        the interests of the Western Australian people as represented by Jim. And so
                                        that was a fantastic negotiation, but it was actually joint problem solving
                                        between the State Government and ourselves</div>
                                    <div class="message to">That's awesome. And then so you took a year off.
                                        What, led you to take the year off, first of all, and then how did you spend it
                                        and I am interested in looking back on it, what sort of impact do you think that
                                        taking that year off had on your life and career? What did you learn over that
                                        time?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">No, I think I think so. The reason we took a
                                        year off is Tina was on an executive contract and it had an end date. And of
                                        course, that meant that all of her long term incentives would be vested if her
                                        other alternative was to go to full time, which you don't have any control of
                                        necessarily when you leave anymore. And so she just said, look, she had been
                                        working for Woodside for 24 years, direct report to CEO, you know, she ticked
                                        every box so she decided that was going to be enough and just confluence of
                                        timing. And then our financial planner, who was the architect of what we call
                                        "the plan" trademark, which, you know, our long term life plan, which was to
                                        retire down here</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Congratulations</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, thank you. It's actually he said, well, you guys can
                                        afford to hit your plan goals and still take a year off like nobody gets this
                                        opportunity. To do this. And so, yeah, we lived down here in Pemberton. My
                                        father and his all of his siblings came here to visit and that was a huge
                                        bonding moment for my aunts and uncles. We traveled to Canada and just really
                                        sampled life, what it would be down here, you know, I volunteered and got
                                        trained up as bushfire fighters, so it was just a great year off</div>

                                        probably needed the break. So yeah, I think the biggest thing is when you really
                                        need a break, the first thing that your brain is unable to do is know that it
                                        needs a break. And so, yeah, it was just it was just really, really good timing.
                                        You know, it was really interesting. I remember it was like the last day of work
                                        before I actually had the year off. And Sean Gregory, our senior vice president,
                                        said, Russ let's go for coffee and so went for for coffee with him. I still
                                        remember exactly where we went on the terrace and he said, look, in a year or
                                        so, you know, the CEO and I are thinking about starting up an artificial
                                        intelligence data science team. Would you be willing to come back and lead some
                                        of that for us? And I remember just looking at him and saying, you bastard. I'm
                                        about to have a year off and you got me excited about coming back, because he
                                        knows I'm a geek. We used to play video games together</div>
                                    <div class="message to">He knew what he was doing haha</div>
                                    <div class="message from">during the time off, I had to tell our then
                                        CFO, Lowrie Tremaine, that, you know, I didn't want to come back as a commercial
                                        person. Yeah. And I think he really thought like, I don't know if you're
                                        thinking I was kind of rejecting his tribe. Yeah, but he was really questioning
                                        that decision and then talked to Rob Cool and said, no, no. I think this is
                                        really, you know, who gets an opportunity like this in their life, right? To
                                        learn about some of these emerging technologies that people are almost thinking
                                        is a joke right now. I remember, you know, head of artificial intelligence, it
                                        got Snickers in 2015. How times have changed, right. So I came back sort of
                                        being a one man band in terms of our artificial intelligence work and eventually
                                        getting a few people Luana Barron and Caitlin Bushell to help out. And you know,
                                        we were able to work with IBM, do some pretty innovative work, I put some of the
                                        LNG contract terms in to this AI work, we don't know if this is going to work or
                                        not. So we, we got that contract done and it wasn't it wasn't going completely
                                        well in the beginning</div>
                                    <div class="message to">The contract or the work?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">The relationship with IBM and Woodside over
                                        with the first month or so, we struggled. We struggled until we got to the point
                                        where we actually left their sales and pre-sales and marketing people behind.
                                        And once we started talking to the detail technical people, I remember, you
                                        know, Zena Washington from IBM was there and I was asked some basic questions
                                        because I didn't know anything about machine learning at the time. And she was
                                        very truthful and honest, like "no, one instance can't learn from another
                                        instance" and things like that. So that really quickly established a trust. And
                                        as soon that clicked, I mean we had our first operational AI up and adding
                                        value within months. Yeah. 300 Woodsiders volunteered 3 hours each to do some of
                                        the training. Yeah. So that was certainly the Watson era</div>
                                    <div class="message to">You you take the year off, your coming into a
                                        completely new field, coming into head of AI, as you said, you know, AI's
                                        starting to come back again. You know, it's a fairly new concept. It was
                                        definitely new to Woodside, you know, brand new team. How did you go about first
                                        determining what to like, which problem to work on first? What was your thought
                                        process in your strategy about like, okay, new team, new field, new function.
                                        What do we even do here? How do we start?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, look, I mean, that was absolutely
                                        correct. So what we what we ended up doing is forming a joint sort of early
                                        studies group with ourselves and the AI machine learning natural language
                                        processing experts from IBM. We held workshops with a predominantly three groups
                                        and we wanted to make sure that any successes we would have would be material to
                                        a, you know, tens of billions of dollars company. Well, that very quickly
                                        narrows it down to operations, major capital projects and probably marketing.
                                        Yeah. So those were the big levers so we sat down with with those groups of
                                        people and we iterated around what the problems were versus did the technical
                                        people on the IBM side truly believe we have a chance of solving this? Most AI
                                        systems are deep and narrow so they can recognize cat videos. Right so its seen
                                        a lot of cats and so it can pick out cats from videos. One of the approaches we
                                        took is, could we turn that on a little bit on its side and say, look, can we
                                        just have a natural language query system that could look over all of our static
                                        documents for all of our major capital projects? Because each capital project
                                        probably has 25 million reports associated with it. Nobody could ever read them
                                        all. And unlike the technology that Google has, it's basically, you know,
                                        answering questions based on geographic area. So if you look for local cafes and
                                        you know who pays the most and how popular is that website? Well, none of those
                                        techniques work for internal documents. And so we were making the same mistakes
                                        over and over again. We weren't learning from, you know, even simple questions.
                                        How do you deter birds from the helicdecks? That was one of the first problems
                                        that this natural language system was actually able to solve. And ir would say
                                        you've already solved it before. You already paid $20 million to solve it, but
                                        it was in a report you never would have found for the text search
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">During the work at IBM, you were over in Texas at
                                        Austin Labs a fair bit, which you be able to talk to how the interactions with
                                        NASA started?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, so we were in a lot of work with the IBM
                                        Watson Development Labs in Austin, Texas. And one of the avenues that was
                                        emergent, we actually jointly went into, it's like, well, you know, could an AI
                                        be more than just a question and answering tool? And the two grads that we had
                                        seconded over there and the IBM staff, we eventually just developed a system
                                        where you could control a robotic system just with voice, you know, robot, raise
                                        your arm. And the robot would reply, I don't know how to raise my arm. That's
                                        okay. I will teach you. Raise your left arm. Open your left hand. Lower your
                                        left arm. That's how you wave. Oh now I know how to wave</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And then tell us what I said yes to?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yes. The answer is yes. Russ Now fly over there
                                        and figure out what I just said yes to. Yeah. Okay. So it was nice feeling to be
                                        supported from the from the business. So Shelley Kalms and myself, we headed
                                        over to Johnson Space Center and we met with a group, one or two people in head
                                        of robotics at the time, and then we went on a bit of a tour and we really
                                        didn't probably realise we were getting interviewed because after the tour of
                                        the High Bay and all the different robotic systems and we were explaining our
                                        new use cases versus what they need them for. We got back to a meeting room and
                                        the meeting room was full of NASA people. Okay, so clearly each time we had an
                                        interaction, somebody would go back and talk to the different teams and we
                                        walked out of there with more things on our plate than we could ever do in human
                                        lifetimes. The ability for robotic systems and for remote sensing remote
                                        operations was vital to both organisations. And to be honest, the personalities
                                        clicked</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Hmm. Which is half of that</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Which is half that. And we had the same
                                        passion, enthusiasm and same value structures there. And then so over the next
                                        six months, some very fine people at the International Affairs Office in
                                        Washington DC out of NAS and then ourselves, we negotiated and this is where my
                                        history of being a negotiator really helps. So we negotiated an International
                                        Space Act agreement which would have staff secondees which would have technology
                                        sharing, which would have hardware such as the robonaut sharing. And we got that
                                        done within about four or five months. And of course, it had to go to the
                                        highest levels of NASA because we are a foreign company that does compete with
                                        American companies. Yeah, but each of them had had the opportunity and for
                                        whatever reason decided to do their own thing. And hence the relationship with
                                        NASA was born robonaut was shipped over. And it was funny. Rachel Cooke, she was
                                        the Consul General to Western Australia at the time, invited myself and Julia
                                        over to the Culture General's office in Perth and she said, you've got this
                                        agreement, an international agreement done in five months. She said, you need to
                                        let us know who in the State Department helped facilitate that because they will
                                        literally get a medal. And Julie and I just look at each other. It's like we
                                        didn't actually have any help by anybody. We just did it ourselves. And so I
                                        think that had a good laugh and we were able to get on and really jointly lift
                                        the game in terms of the skill sets of both teams, actually. I think the you
                                        certainly know in your interaction with the NASA staff how many of them said
                                        when they get seconded over, it's the most intense learning of robotics they get
                                        because it's in a different environment, different context. And certainly when
                                        we had the initial team put together in the AI/robotics area, I couldn't do
                                        anything. I'm not a roboticist. I couldn't help them train up. And so we
                                        negotiated with NASA and we did a three months secondee of my team into theirs,
                                        into their area. And so they could learn the basics of ROS or affordance
                                        template technology <a href="#" class="footnote-button"

Affordance Templates is a ROS package for quickly programming, adjusting, and executing robot applications in the ROS RViz environment. This package extends the capabilities of RViz interactive markers by allowing an operator to specify multiple end-effector waypoint locations and grasp poses in object-centric coordinate frames. Affordance Templates were developed by the NASA-JSC DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) team and have since successfully been deployed on multiple platforms including the NASA Valkyrie and Robonaut 2 humanoids. Woodside utilised this technology on a Cleapath Husky with dual UR-5 arms. <a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDLQYGw0aSU&t=1896s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Here</a> is a video of the capability being showcased at Amazon re:MARS 2019.

, autonomous manipulation of objects, that sort of that sort
                                        of thing. So that worked out really beautifully</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Which is just an amazing opportunity for someone
                                        from Perth to be able to do</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Or somebody from Karratha. So it was
                                        interesting when they brought down the robonaut that was on the International
                                        Space Station, so they needed to upgrade its power supply and do some repairs on
                                        it. And so they asked us, do you have any technicians available? And so Pickles,
                                        Michael Peters, he's a he's a comms tech up a Karratha, born and bred or a
                                        really nice, great guy. Everybody loves pickles. And we said, look, can you, can
                                        you go to NASA Johnson Space Center and help repair the on orbit robot. Sure, he
                                        absolutely loved it. So Andrew Corrigan went as an electrical engineer and
                                        Pickles went as a tech. And of course, you can imagine how much interest then
                                        you get when actually somebody that's on the tools up at our operational
                                        facilities is actually getting these opportunities and actually secondees coming
                                        back. Logan and Christa. So Logan was a robotics engineer now, so he
                                        subsequently joined a startup and his wife Kristen. Kristen actually she is the
                                        head of the flight deck for attitude and altitude control. So basically her job
                                        is to certify and watch over the people that fly the space station. Yeah. So
                                        they got to talk to all the kids at Karratha. So it was really, really good. We
                                        could, we could show teh TAFE and the high school and even the children of
                                        employees, the robots we were using. So what really made it, I think that really
                                        engaged the people and it also it also settled any arguments or any worry that
                                        the robots were going to take people's jobs. Because they're tools, these are
                                        not going to replace humans</div>

                                        the robotics team at Woodside. I think just like when the AI tema started, you
                                        know, it turned a few heads, seemed a bit before its time. How did you find the
                                        process of taking something that, you know, seems like sci fi and bringing it to
                                        reality at Woodside. Again how did you start in an area that's so new and
                                        innovative</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I think, you know, having been involved with
                                        profit loss asset management, so it's my job to make sure these assets are as
                                        profitable as possible, you start to very quickly learn where the levers are.
                                        And I think that that was what I could add most to my team. So everybody else on
                                        my team, you know, you would have heard me say, I work very hard to make sure
                                        I'm the stupidest person on my team. And so they're all brilliant technical
                                        people, but they don't know the value of solving problem X versus problem Y. And
                                        so that's where I could add value to the team is to help them prioritise that.
                                        Like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now if you can actually solve tha, that's game changing.
                                        Yeah and a lot of times it would be that, you know, simple $100 sensors could
                                        solve a lot of problems. And we sort of came up with a what's the minimum viable
                                        technoloy, let's just solve the problem. Because anytime you make it more
                                        complex, it's harder to maintain or replicate. So I actually think the key to
                                        success in hindsight was putting a business person in charge of that technology
                                        group because it just allowed us to prioritise and get the wins on the board. As
                                        soon as we had the wins on the board. You know, Sean often told me I've never
                                        had to argue for your budget, Russ, because every time somebody would say did
                                        they need that much? Everybody around, whether it was, you know, our chief
                                        operations officer, Meg O'Neill at the time, now CEO, they would be the people
                                        defending it</div>
                                    <div class="message to">When you have something like undertaking a task
                                        of assembling a robotics team, what's the thought process? The analysis that
                                        goes into building that team for success in an area that is, as I said,
                                        technically difficult but is also culturally difficult. It's a bit before its
                                        time. Yeah. How do you go about that process of assembling that team?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well, I think the biggest thing is realizing
                                        that your job is actually to develop the capability to enable robotic solutions.
                                        So, you know, while the the robots in the lab and, you know, the site trials we
                                        did on these particular individual physical robotic bodies added value and
                                        shaped the vision for the company. What I was really focused on is to make sure
                                        Woodside had a robust capability to continue to develop robotic solutions. So I
                                        think that's the thing that a lot of people, when they visit the lab missed.
                                        It's like they see the physical robots, they see it turning valves or they see
                                        it doing some surveillance work or the sensors adding value, creating that sort
                                        of digital twin. They saw that, but I don't think they really realize that those
                                        are individual solutions at a point in time. But really, what you need to focus
                                        on is, does your organization have the capability to work with these
                                        technologies and implement them. Because there is no potential future world
                                        where the increased automation, increased data science, AI is not playing an
                                        important role in any business. Yeah. And so you need the capability to keep up
                                        with that technology and and implement those solutions</div>
                                    <div class="message to">There's no world in which it's going to become
                                        less important, and if you can accept that</div>
                                    <div class="message from">But we did also, you know, it wasn't, you know,
                                        we needed to have quick wins. Yes. So it's not necessarily billions of dollars
                                        value adding. But this is a practical technology that, you know, we aren't just
                                        sitting in some robotics lab theorizing over potential slam models or whatever
                                        that particular thing is, we're actually getting value add. Yeah. And that was
                                        nice when, when Jason Crusan had joined Woodside, certainly the ability for us
                                        to showcase our capabilities helped, you know, these advanced technologies got
                                        the interest of all of the oil and gas, defense sector, space sector, and that
                                        actually opened up new alliances. Australian Submarine Corp, you know, and all
                                        of a sudden you're getting this more and more diverse skill set. So, you know.
                                        If you can get to a point where people understand with the vision that you're
                                        creating is going to actually add tremendous value. Plus then you're actually
                                        paying your own way ten times over with problems you're solving. Then, yeah, no
                                        end of what resources are made available to you</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah. You sort of started leading towards my next
                                        question that external collaboration has obviously been something that you've
                                        always been huge on and you mentioned before with defense, NASA, Australian
                                        Submarine Corp. Can you explain your views on the importance of external
                                        collaboration? And what was it about your approach that you think made you
                                        successful at it? I mean, for me, looking in, you know, I think your ability to
                                        drum up that vision and get people all excited and from completely different
                                        fields, all working together was fairly unique. So keen to see your view and
                                        what about your style do you think led you up to success?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well, I think being able to... There is a big
                                        difference on building a business relationship and building a strategic
                                        alliance. Alliance partners go above and beyond what's ever written in the
                                        contract to help each other out. And I was very keen to make that happen because
                                        we can't move into this world at this stage ourselves. It would take decades to
                                        build up the capability required on machine learning and robotics and all of the
                                        many fields that support those sort of two endeavors. And it was also the
                                        identification of where we are actually working all on a very, very similar
                                        problems. So Rio Tinto with the remote mine sites, you know, Woodside with, you
                                        know, hundreds of kilometers offshore with nobody on that platform. We have
                                        increasingly automation of the Defense Force and I'm not talking just the famous
                                        drones that everybody knows about, but, you know, crewless surface vessels,
                                        submarines. And so we really realize that we're all basically working on this
                                        same problem is how do we operate these assets remotely, more remotely, or at
                                        least have our cameras and our robots and our sensors be able to inform the
                                        maintenance crews before they fly a three hour flight and then a two hour
                                        helicopter ride offshore to realise they don't have the right parts. And so
                                        everybody sort of really realized this was a common problem. And I said, look,
                                        we can all bang or heads against it separately but I suspect as a collective,
                                        you know, whether it's NASA and Woodside and our joint venture partners, we've
                                        already solved the problem. We all have the pieces, but it would each take us 15
                                        years to find all the other pieces. Yeah. Or we could just look at each other as
                                        puzzle blocks. And you know, and we don't compete, NASA's not going to compete
                                        for oil and gas contracts and we're not going to necessarily launch rockets to
                                        the moon, so why not work together? </div>
                                    <div class="message to">So I guess that sort of leads into, during that
                                        period of the robotics team, obviously we're doing a lot of external
                                        collaboration. As you said, NASA people being seconded and working with Fugro, a
                                        bunch of different people in that remote operation space. Would you be able to
                                        speak to how AROSE started and what the vision you had for it was?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, so the Australian remote operations for
                                        Space and Earth, it was really the brainchild of myself and Pam Melroy. So in
                                        our robotics lab, the Australian Space Agency was announced with the national
                                        robot in the background. It just makes too good television. So right from
                                        literally the beginning, had great relationships with the Australian Space
                                        Agency and was invited to when it was announced. Okay. What are our strategic
                                        priorities need to be? Because it is not NASA, it is not going to receive $21
                                        billion a year, it's not going to have the fundamental science research program.
                                        So there's just not that much money to go around. And so I was at a workshop in
                                        Brisbane and was talking about our relationship with NASA already and how the
                                        remote operations leverages the incredible technological advances that Western
                                        Australia and Australia more generally already have. And you know, the
                                        autonomous mining is well, well known. Normally uncrewed oil and gas facilities,
                                        well known. And you had companies like Boeing with their loyal wingman and
                                        program in Brisbane, you know, with the drone support fighter that flies along,
                                        you know, the the human piloted aircraft. And so we have a lot of this
                                        technology and it's something that I think Australia can provide the
                                        international space community. And so Pam Melroy. So Pam, former astronaut,
                                        colonel, test pilot in the US Air Force and she is now currently the deputy
                                        director of NASA, so she was President Biden's pick for that job. She was also
                                        at that workshop. Her and Doug were living in Adelaide at the time, they were
                                        doing some consulting work for Nova Systems, which is a defense contractor and
                                        the founder of Nova Systems and Pam were best friends who were test pilots
                                        together and so that's how that relationship went. So I was there and I kind of
                                        said this is where I think Australia can really add value to the international
                                        space faring nation. And I didn't know at the time, you know, so in listening to
                                        Pam's speeches afterwards she said, I looked at that guy and I made a note, I
                                        need to talk to him because yes, there is not another nation that really
                                        provides the overall remote operations solution. Nobody else is stepping into
                                        that space as Australia does. And so Pam and I got talking at that workshop and
                                        then she flew over to Perth and we may have had a couple of bottles of blue in a
                                        state, Archer's Chardonnay and they had a tea house. And I said, Look, what we
                                        really need is to get the Australian Institute of Remote Operations involved.
                                        And she's like what? There's such a thing? That's perfect Russ, why don't you
                                        tell me? I'm like, Oh, no, no, no, that doesn't exist. We're going to have to do
                                        it. Yeah, we're going to build it. And so, you know Pam and I drafted a like a
                                        little bit of white paper and never made beyond draft. We circulated it to
                                        several universities and governments and it very, very quickly realized we
                                        touched a nerve. Like this is something. And so Fugro was keen Curtin
                                        University, UWA all wanted to get together and yes let's as a nonprofit
                                        corporation really take the bilateral collaboration that we were doing with NASA
                                        and Woodside. So what if we made that national and international size? What if
                                        we just upgraded that to the next level and hence AROSE was born, received
                                        tremendous amount of support from the Australian Space Agency. We announced on
                                        their space conference in Adelaide on it would have been in the Friday and we
                                        formally announced AROSE to the world on the Thursday and then we quickly got on
                                        a plane, flew over to, to Adelaide and you know, everybody at the space agency
                                        said, Well, Russ, you guys don't even have a table here and I was like you
                                        wouldn't have even had a chance to know. And the space agency rather graciously
                                        offered up half of their table. And so nothing they could have done would have
                                        actually showed support for AROSE more than that. And I think, you know, that
                                        was the nature of that. And so, you know, having somebody from industry here in
                                        Australia and somebody of Pam's background, well, this is it, you know, and I
                                        remember even when we had the launch of AROSE that, you know, Rio Tinto hadn't
                                        even formally joined, but their staff were helping. You know, and so we had the
                                        foundation members, which was great. But then once we did form, we had many
                                        other, you know, QUT joined up. We had MDA, which is the firm in Canada that
                                        builds, maintains and operates the canadarm on the space shuttles and then
                                        subsequently the International Space Station. So it's it's really taken off,
                                        which I think that, you know, I think people generally want to collaborate. But
                                        because the agreements and institutions behind allowing that collaboration to
                                        happen, you kind of need the innovators, plus the builders, the people that
                                        could actually get it done. And once the platform is there, everybody wants to
                                        pile in and contribute and it's running for not a lot of drain from the from the
                                        state and federal government. But we can actually provide the best solutions for
                                        lunar rovers, etc., by using technology from all over. Some from NASA. Some from
                                        Rio Tinto, some from Fugro, some from Woodside, some from QUT, some from Curtin,
                                        UWA. So we put all that together and oh pretty soon we've got a real solution
                                        here</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah, that's awesome</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. So, no, I think I think that was really
                                        that was really, really good to start that up and then to see the level of
                                        support that people have given it has been great</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Over your career, you spent a large portion of that career
                                        in roles that required strategy and tactical skills. I'm curious as to how that
                                        experience and building those skills helped you in some of these other
                                        technology roles, like head of AI or robotics or in starting up AROSE. Which you
                                        be able toto speak to to that</div>
                                    <div class="message from">You know, similar to all of the roles of had is
                                        what's the long term objective? What are we really trying to do, whether it's
                                        building capability in advanced technology, being able to leverage AI to
                                        transform our ability and lower the costs of our business or just not make the
                                        same mistakes again, at least make new mistakes. You know, so what is that? And
                                        being able to clearly articulate that lighthouse vision on the hill. You really
                                        need that if you are going get people on board. But then you also have to
                                        convince people that is not just, hey, I've got a cool idea, and wouldn't it be
                                        cool if we could execute it? Is turning that then into a rigorously detailed
                                        plan. Okay, maybe on a quarterly basis it's going to take three or four years to
                                        get here, but then commit to the board or to the members of AROSE. Here's what
                                        you're going to see quarter by quarter that will actually march us there. And so
                                        once people see a vision and they see that actually there's a plan behind the
                                        vision, then people get quite excited about that. And, you know, I remember
                                        every time a previous CEO came down a lot. Peter Coleman, last question before
                                        he left was always, what more do you need?</div>
                                    <div class="message to">That's amazing</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Is it money? I'm like, Peter, you could up the
                                        budget. But to be honest, we're probably we're at that cusp of not wasting it.
                                        You know, we could always go off different avenues of inquiry, but sometimes,
                                        throwing more money at the problem actually doesn't solve itself. And so being
                                        able to have those realistic conversations with your alliance members is
                                        important. And the thing is, you have to cultivate the alliance. So a lot of
                                        things we would do for IBM, let's say, for example, is we wouldn't necessarily
                                        have done for our traditional oil and gas contractors. We don't go to their
                                        conferences and show people what we have value added with their products. But
                                        remember how early days this was for IBM? We were more important to them as a
                                        showcase of actually industrial value add of the Watson AI family. They spent
                                        more money on marketing our use case or our success case than we ever would have
                                        paid them in fees. Yeah, but that was important because that's what we could
                                        provide them. They could provide us cutting edge technology that nobody else had
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">And access to the best teams</div>

                                        Watson Natural language processing systems were never designed for tens of
                                        millions of documents. Never. Not even a fraction of that. They were designed
                                        more for chatbot style things where you know the short tail, if you're an AI
                                        person, a short tail versus long tail answers <a href="#" class="footnote-button"

Yeah and so that's the true

                                        friends. And that's been that's been great</div>

                                        you've been able to be so extremely effective in fields that you weren't
                                        necessarily a technical SME, but you know, you were head of AI. You know, as you
                                        said, you hadn't done any AI before that. Same with robotics. Can you explain
                                        how you were able to do that, sort of go into these highly technical fields
                                        without a very deep background yourself, but still able to be extremely
                                        effective and build such momentum in those areas. Like how do you go about doing
                                        that?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I think generally being passionate about that
                                        and caring for the people under your chain of command and genuinely wanting to
                                        make sure that there succesful, because you know, I don't know anything about to
                                        robotics or I didn't. So yre not going to be successful unless they are
                                        tremendously successful. You know, setting that strategic vision, as we said.
                                        But also, I was very passionate about not wanting to be just a business manager
                                        with a white collar shirt or whatever like that. And so in each of these cases,
                                        whether it was mergers and acquisitions, I got a very traditional M&A focused
                                        MBA. So you need to actually really learn all of these skills. And some people
                                        like that do that and some people don't. I remember getting the AI job and it's
                                        like, well, I need to know how to machine learn. Like I need to know what this
                                        stuff is. And so I did one of the MIT classes Analytics Edge 12 week intensive
                                        course which is archived now but you know your very first week you're programing
                                        in R and finding correlations on infant mortality and then you are doing machine
                                        learning algorithms on trying to determine how a U.S. Supreme Court judge is
                                        going to vote. Pretty scary when my model got 98% accuracy. Or entering data
                                        science competitions online. So one of the ones I entered was from the New York
                                        Times and how to predict which articles, online articles are going to be
                                        popular. So many likes or so many shares. And you know, I think on that one, I
                                        came in, you know, 37th out of the competition, but there was over 3000 people.
                                        So I think, you know, I did not know it because I was never going to code in the
                                        AI team or in the robotics team. But I really needed to develop an intuitive
                                        feeling of what kind of problems these technologies can solve and what it can't.
                                        And if you don't go down that rabbit hole, when you change jobs into a new area,
                                        you are at the mercy for every snake oil salesman out there</div>

                                    <div class="message from">Absolutely. Yeah. And so being able to actually

                                        that. But I think what really it gives them, it gives them the proof that you
                                        are actually committed to them. Like you're not going to like from scratch learn
                                        how to, you know, how a natural language processing engine works or
                                        classification system or linear optimization or any like you're not going to
                                        want to, you know, if you're not passionate about what they're passionate about,
                                        you're not going to do that. And so you offered them some proof of that. Of my
                                        convictions and also I think allowed me to do the translation between. Techie
                                        geek speak and business results. Whether that's at the board level. So when I
                                        took the board on a tour of NASA Johnson Space Center, really as also speak both
                                        languages. Well, they loved it. Yeah. Or, you know, sending NASA secondees to
                                        North Rankin. You know, what are we trying to achieve here? Well, how I would
                                        pitch that would be different to both audiences because they speak different
                                        languages. So I think that really helps there as well </div>
                                    <div class="message to">I think that again touches into my next point.
                                        One of the things that also amazed me was your ability to earn the respect,
                                        trust and support of senior leadership, so you touched on before with the board
                                        and with Peter Coleman when he asked you, you know, what else do you need? What
                                        about your style and approach, do you think sort of made you successful in
                                        earning that support from senior leadership and management? And what advice
                                        would you give to people?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well, a couple of things. I had the benefit of
                                        being at woodside for 22 years on these various roles. So I had a lot of trust
                                        capital</div>
                                    <div class="message to">That's a good term</div>

                                        for an AI system we created and that was Fiona Hick. She was head of HSE at the
                                        time and she said what's the system going to look like? I don't Fiona. You know,
                                        our AI specialists and your HSE people will actually jointly create a system
                                        that doesn't exist and she says, well I've never signed up for anything like
                                        that. What's it going to cost with me? Told her the cost, X number of hundreds
                                        of thousands of dollars, X number of months? It was just we'll see where we get
                                        to. She said I wouldn't sign this for anybody else. But I've worked with you for
                                        20 years, so I'm not trusting the contract, I am trusting you. Yeah. And so that
                                        helped. And the fact that we were able to deliver that for hundreds of thousands
                                        of dollars cheaper and, you know, quicker. And then we moved on to the next
                                        thing. So I think, you know, that certainly helps</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Trade on your name as they say</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So I did have that background. Yeah. But then
                                        partly because while I didn't communicate it well, I had the plan to retire.
                                        There was nothing I needed, I didn't need anything personally from this</div>
                                    <div class="message to">As in, there was no ulterior motives</div>
                                    <div class="message from">No ulterior motives. I'm not trying to I'm not
                                        trying to aim for the next promotion and the next job. I'm just trying to do
                                        good work. I love my work. I love the people that I'm working with. I need to
                                        prepare them because I knew in the back of my head I'm leaving. I needed to
                                        prepare them for the leadership positions when I left. And so I think all those
                                        things we naturally know we need to do anyway. But it ground home like it it
                                        added a sense of urgency to me. So being able to develop the people, you know,
                                        like, you know yourself like Ali, you know, even giving people like Luana Barron
                                        and Caitlin a taster, even if they didn't, this wasn't going to be their thing
                                        forever or all the way up to, you know, one of my favorite things is, you know,
                                        finally getting Dee Jones as a lab manager, but then seeing her passion and her
                                        ability to work with her hands to repair these robotic systems, second her over
                                        to NASA to the technicians and have somebody whose job title used to be admin
                                        assistant, now it's robotic technician. I mean, you know, you hear CEOs and
                                        politicians and talk about the jobs of the future, but very few can offer a
                                        concrete example as that. And it sort of shatters the notion that this jobs
                                        revolution is only for PhD students and computer geeks. It's not. It is for
                                        everybody
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah. Now, that was definitely another common
                                        theme that I suppose the culture that you set in the lab, which was, you know,
                                        how do we get like the TAFEs involved, you know, and not having necessarily like
                                        strict requirements on as you said, needed to have a background of robotics in
                                        order to be effective in it</div>
                                    <div class="message from">No, you don't. And I think, you know, we're in
                                        the golden age of education where anybody, you know, you don't even need a high
                                        school degree. You can go on EDEX, Coursera, you can go on like the robotic
                                        operating systems. NASA's got such great open source things. You know, we're in
                                        the golden age of education where anybody can access this, in particular in a
                                        growing, you know, what's perceived as real in a growing inequality. So, you
                                        know, especially in a field for for, you know, people normal salaries in the
                                        United States where, you know, I remember going to one low, quote unquote, low
                                        fee paying university, and they were quite chuffed that they were only charging
                                        $40,000 a year tuition. Only. And you know, USD. And so this whole growing
                                        divide of, you know, you know, these higher education institutions are only for
                                        people with wealth. You know what I'm talking predominantly United States. You
                                        know, the HECS system here in Australia is fantastic. But the reality is the
                                        certification of talent is not the monopoly purview of the universities anymore.
                                        You have Google saying you can do a six month course, and we we consider that
                                        equivalent to a four year degree. You have a AWS, very, very similar. Amazon,
                                        very, very similar. In fact, the more courses you complete with them, the more
                                        job opportunities internally open up with you. So I actually think that's
                                        probably more the wave of the future because you know. People graduating from,
                                        say, high school right now, they'll be doing jobs like nobody. We didn't have
                                        like machine learning people at Woodside, or roboticists at a mining company,
                                        you know, 20 odd years ago. Maybe Rio Tinto made moves so maybe them, but
                                        they're going to need to learn new skills that's going to be their superpower,
                                        not learn anythin in particular because all this stuff changes so rapidly. Even
                                        if we had to completely rebuild the first AI system, just because in three years
                                        it was completely archaic and so much had changed like we may as will been
                                        programing in, you know Egyptian hieroglyphics. The computer code crashed
                                        because it didn't you know, the line didn't end with men pouring water man
                                        pouring water little birdie that's that degree of change requires the ability to
                                        learn not a static knowledge set</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Right. You also touched on this earlier when
                                        you're talking about setting a vision with the lighthouse analogy, in my
                                        experience in the lab, one thing was that everyone was extremely motivated and
                                        everyone was on board with the mission. How do you, as a leader, go about
                                        creating a vision and sharing that vision to inspire and motivate a team? Like,
                                        what's your style?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, my style is probably speechcraft. So
                                        talking it through, you know, what is the vision? What are we trying to achieve?
                                        What are the quarterly goals? And then once you give people quarterly goals,
                                        basically they can solve, you know, the two weekly sprints by themselves. You
                                        don't need to really get involved with that. I think one of the advantages that
                                        we had in the lab is that got people so aligned to the vision is they heard it
                                        every second day as we had the tours because people like, why are you working
                                        with NASA? And it's all the same questions and this is why, remote operations
                                        and being able to prototype and you know, two weeks sprint and all of that sort
                                        of stuff and here's where we're aiming towards. And although we, we were very
                                        careful not to try to interrupt the people that are coding, you know, headphones
                                        and everything like that, you don't need to be interrupted because the minister
                                        is coming through. But hearing in the background that sort of same story and
                                        consistent story over and over again, changed subtly for the audience. Whether
                                        it's politicians, we talk more about jobs, the future. Where as with mining
                                        companies we talk more about the generic remote operations capability set that's
                                        required </div>
                                    <div class="message to">So it definitely consolidates, especially when
                                        your getting us to help give those presentations</div>
                                    <div class="message from">You have to explain the story. In the corner
                                        it's the analogy where you never understand something as well as when you have
                                        to teach it. So if you have to articulate the strategy, you probably know what
                                        it is. Yeah. You know, and I think you know, but how we got there, so this is
                                        what we want to achieve. But the range of technology, that's not for me. That's
                                        so I think we had kind of clear everybody had a clear role in developing the
                                        strategy. This is what we want to achieve. Yeah. But then how we go about it, I
                                        don't know, that's for you to figure out</div>
                                    <div class="message to">As in like each person felt like that they had
                                        their own stake in help creating that vision

                                    <div class="message from">And look, I think the two week, the showcases
                                        and having each person being able to showcase to the rest of the team, the
                                        progress they made in the past two weeks of course. You know one of the results
                                        of that is an incredible pride in your work. And wow, we've cracked this problem
                                        and people, you know, getting literally applause from the rest of the lab. But
                                        then, you know, Sean Gregory might come down to just sit on that. So now you're
                                        showcasing that to one of the executives. Not too many people get to do that on
                                        a deeply personal this is my three or four person team accomplishments. And then
                                        but that also, I think, had a profound impact on bringing whoever the end users
                                        were going to be or whoever's problems you're trying to solve and having them
                                        demo, you know, having an HSE person demo this new, you know automated hazard
                                        detection or the drilling engineers. It's very, very powerful to suck them into
                                        it. And I remember when we with the geoscientists and the drilling engineers at
                                        the end of that three or four month build for their solution, they could talk
                                        machine learning, text annotation as well as anybody on my team could. And
                                        literally one of the IBM programmers, he would be 2 to 3 hours in a conversation
                                        about drilling engineering before you would realize he's maybe not a drilling
                                        engineer So that depth of knowledge that both parties got really contributed to
                                        that shared vision, I think
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah, setting the vision for your own internal
                                        team is one thing, but then, you know, like at the end of the day, if you're
                                        building a product and you have end users that you need to accept that product,
                                        it makes it a lot easier if you bring them along and incorporate them in that
                                        vision and you did that </div>
                                    <div class="message from">It's their product not ours</div>
                                    <div class="message to">But you did that all the time. Like, yeah,
                                        they're the same people that I have platforms. But I remember like, you know, we
                                        would deliberately get, people from operations like whether it was Ryan, to help
                                        out with the remote ops of operating the robots</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. Where we had an ops manager come in.
                                        Never seen the robot before. Beccarelli. And we set a challenge. I said to Mary,
                                        start your watch. He gets 60 seconds of training on how to drive this robot
                                        around offshore while he's in the Woodside head office. And so, you know, you
                                        kind of set that very visceral challenge. The UI, the systems have got to be
                                        that intuitive, you know, in the end. And the smile on his face, he just like
                                        suddenly he had a great time</div>
                                    <div class="message to">But I mean, like after that interaction he will
                                        be like, very close to being 100% on board with what you guys are trying to do
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Oh, absolutely. And people actually got it,
                                        actually. You know, and he did. He said, look, what we really need on this thing
                                        is we didn't have it. We had microphones so we could hear, but we did have a
                                        speaker. And so he actually wanted to use the robot in a little bit of a
                                        telepresence mode and like, oh, well, that is trivial to do. Yeah, I said that
                                        would add so much value. So if, if we had like a killer rotating equipment
                                        engineer, literally telepresence robot up to an offshore and then being able to
                                        have a conversation with a technician that's right there. Yeah. He said, I'm
                                        like, this would save us millions of dollars in helicopter flights. Okay,
                                        trivial</div>

                                        does. So in 2020 you retired. You're now living a nice, humble life down here in
                                        Pemberton with your wife Tina. I mean, I was personally shocked at the news
                                        obviously because I knew how much you loved what he did. But I guess, how did
                                        you know the time was right? Like in your mind, how did you know the time was
                                        right to retire?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, I think well, a couple of different
                                        things. So we certainly got to the place where we were financially independent.
                                        And we've always had the conversation between Tina and myself. You know, country
                                        we're both country kids. This is where we want to we want to live. And, you
                                        know, a couple of things like statistically that, you know, for you and me,
                                        anybody listening to this, this year is going to be your healthiest
                                        statistically. And so we don't know what's going to happen. You know, I've got Crohn's disease. You just don't know what's going to
                                        be around the corner. And so why would you want to die with more money in the
                                        bank? Is one thing. And you know, you've been down here in my home, ten acres in
                                        Pemberton. Yes. I love my job, but I love her more, is the answer and I want to
                                        spend time with Tina. And also, I was smart enough to realize and self-aware
                                        that I am passionate, very passionate about the work that I've done. And so when
                                        I resigned from Woodside, I also knew that I had to resign from the chair of the
                                        Australian Remote Operations Space and Earth, so AROSE and found a replacement
                                        chair. David, if you're listening, thank you for taking the position, Leanne,
                                        thank you for taking the CEO position. Also, I resigned from the chair of the
                                        Defense Science Center. Kirsten Rose thank you for taking that position and also
                                        from the Australian Space Agency Industry Leaders Forum and some sci-tech boards
                                        and things like that, because I knew that I am passionate and so if I retired
                                        but still did all of that, I'd still be working ten hour days from my office
                                        here in Pemberton rather than really doing what I should be doing, which is
                                        okay, what is the next stage of life look like?</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah. And fully embrace it. Looking
                                        back on what we've just sort of ran through a bunch of your career, what do you
                                        think you're most proud of?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">I think I'm most proud of the accomplishments
                                        of others that I've had that I've been able to positively influence. Yeah. Yeah,
                                        absolutely. You know, when I see Julia getting the job of, you know, vehicle
                                        systems integration manager for the Deep Space Gateway, when I see Pam Melroy
                                        being made deputy director of NASA, I'm not taking any credit involved. You
                                        know, Ali, Shawn Fernando coming in as an OIM and now knows robotics. And you
                                        know, Jason Crusan and being able to, to decide to move to Australia with his
                                        family. So, you know, I think the big sort of thing that, you know, you realize
                                        is whatever accomplishments I, I mean business accomplishments, you did a great
                                        deal here and you got Pluto to feed whatever, whatever those things are. Nobody
                                        cares. Yeah, nobody will ever remember. But the so there is no legacy in terms
                                        of accomplishments in that nobody will remember</div>

                                        they all remember. And so that, you know, if you can focus your attention on
                                        making sure that, you know, the people's great values, great capabilities, rise
                                        and succeed in the world, then that's what you should be focused on. And there's
                                        nothing you can do that will make a bigger impact than that</div>

                                        that was was that your your retirement morning tea at Woodside when Ali very
                                        bravely accepted the challenge to go to do a speech and went up to the
                                        microphone and it lasted about 3 seconds before she balled into tears and I
                                        think that was very powerful</div>
                                    <div class="message from">That yeah I guess you know you're right I mean
                                        I guess, you know, and I'm awfully fond of Ali and Dee, you know, everybody
                                        yourself, everybody I've worked with as well. And it was hard and it was but it
                                        was it was the, you know, the videos from around the world, you know, people
                                        expressing like this is the impact you've had on my career, my coaching, things
                                        like that, that really hit home right and it's like yeah. Okay. You've left the

                                        AROSE I think there have gotten opportunities that they never would have gotten
                                        without AROSE. And so I think that's, you know, certainly fantastic and it
                                        perpetuates. And, you know, some people will be benefiting from some of the
                                        alliances that you put together long after nobody remembers who you are</div>
                                    <div class="message to">That's the legacy. Yeah, I think I personally
                                        also am very grateful. I mean, you gave me the chance to come to the robotics
                                        team, which hands down was, you know, my absolute favorite time of my career and
                                        life as well. So thank you</div>

                                        with other companies and, you know, and the best people always did. You know,
                                        the best people are always going to be highly valued by multiple organizations,

                                        there's plenty of opportunities to do that. I mean, so that's that's one of the
                                        things I think really excites me. I think the other thing is really in the
                                        advancements in biomedicine, in genetic engineering, to me, I'm already
                                        personally benefiting it. So with my Crohn's disease has kept in control by
                                        injecting a biological agent into myself every week and that those are a whole
                                        class of treatments that years ago just simply didn't exist. Weren't even
                                        theoretically possible. And so I think we're going to probably see I think
                                        contrary to the current curve, everybody knows Moore's Law. But there's also
                                        Ohm's Law, which is the opposite. In medicine, it tends to be less and less
                                        breakthroughs for every billion dollar spent. But I think there's a chance
                                        that's gonna turn around with more of the in-depth, personalized medicine, AI
                                        helping that and also genetic engineering. So I think those are those are some
                                        pretty exciting things to watch. Look, and to me some of that stuff is even
                                        what's happening now. I mean, the StarLink system, suddenly everybody in the
                                        world that has access to power can have access to the Internet</div>
                                    <div class="message to">We're on that Internet right now</div>
                                    <div class="message from">We are on that Internet right now. Thank you,
                                        Elon. No, but I mean, I think those are pretty powerful technologies. You know,
                                        obviously I'm very excited about the Artemis program with the Australian Space
                                        Agency is supporting under NASA's leadership of, you know, permanent human
                                        settlement on the lunar surface. The moon base as a subsequent test base for
                                        Mars obviously. But you know, it's pretty exciting. That even the people in the
                                        Woodside labs were contributing to humans becoming a truly interplanetary
                                        species. And I will probably and you definitely will see that happen. So, you
                                        know, if you think about humans being an interplanetary species and we will see
                                        that with the moon base if you call moon base interplanetary... But that
                                        accomplishment in human history, I would rank as on par with fire, agriculture
                                        and the wheel. The written word. You know, it will be in the top five things
                                        that our humanity has ever done. Easily</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And we get to see it</div>
                                    <div class="message from">And you get to see it. What an exciting time to
                                        be alive</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yes, that's what I always say. If you could assemble the
                                        most talented team in the world, what problem would you solve?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">You know, I'm tempted to say, like, you know,
                                        we've always got we're always focused about current issues of the day. So
                                        climate change, obviously that horrible situation in the Ukraine. If I could
                                        solve any problem that would have the greatest, probably. FTL. Faster than
                                        light. Right now it's not even theoretically possible. Yeah, there's two let's
                                        say non establishment theories, but unless we solve that one. We're stuck in a
                                        very, very tiny place of the universe forever. And that's not a we just have to
                                        wait till the next engine. That is literally forever. So I think, you know, if I
                                        could theoretically solve a quote unquote problem, it would probably be that or
                                        death, like the natural aging process. It would probably be up there. You know,
                                        obviously we've got the immediate of climate change. I'm hopeful that climate
                                        change with that, we are actually starting to really respond to that now. Is it
                                        too late for 1.5 degrees? I think it is too late, but at least it's now a
                                        serious topic. I mean, you could argue maybe not the Australian Government's
                                        most amazing policy area. But I think as a world, everybody's coming on board.
                                        Yeah. With that, you know, you see everybody trying to do their part. And so
                                        we'll solve that. I'm optimistic because we've solved acid rain. We've solved
                                        the hole in the ozone. You know, the only time now people go hungry on the
                                        planet is when people want them to. Some despot or some warlord wants them to go
                                        hungry</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Like taking out care packages</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. So we've solved some pretty big
                                        challenges, you know, Polio, a lot of the horrific diseases, mumps, you know,
                                        they're gone. The Millennium Goals, we we're educating far more women in terms
                                        of the popular world population than we certainly were doing at the turn of the
                                        century. Far less people living in abject poverty. I mean, there's far more to
                                        go but we've done a hell of a lot. We have done a hell of a lot. You know,
                                        sometimes the younger generation, rightfully, I think, are a little bit miffed
                                        that, you know, obviously inaffordibility of housing, climate change, it's like
                                        you guys left us basically a pile of poo. Yeah, it's like, well, your parents
                                        solved a lot of problems, but we didn't solve all them</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah the next generation has to solve a few
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. Oh absolutely. Yeah. I think we will.
                                        Yeah. I mean I think we've got a fair pathway. I mean we have all of the
                                        technology we need to solve climate change, it's just question of will. We have
                                        in Australia, we have plenty gifted with plenty of uranium. We could have
                                        nuclear power plants all over if we wanted to. It is a choice</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Last question, if you could only recommend one
                                        book to someone for the rest of your life, what would it be?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. I won't accept that. Yeah, but I know you
                                        would know that that was going to be my answer. It's like, yeah, it goes along
                                        with the theory of like, there's one thing that can inspire somebody and
                                        completely change their life. And that may be true, but I think it's more of a
                                        holistic context of everything that you've learned, witnessed, appreciated that
                                        can actually help you move your life. What I would say to people is, rather than
                                        read a story, write one. What do you want your life to be? Where is your
                                        happiness points? Where do you want to see yourself in 20, 30, 40 years? When
                                        you retire and you're in this chair giving this little interview</div>

                                        it. And it's going to change, right? Yeah. But so many people just drift from
                                        day to day. Very few people have a plan. Yeah. So have a plan. Have an ambition.

                            <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">💡 Key Messages</h1>
                        </section>

                        <p>Here are my key takeaways from the podcast.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Don't let what you studied constrain your dreams</b> - Russ proved and demonstrated
                                that you don't need a tertiary
                                education in a field to be succesful, both through his own work and those around him
                                that he uplifted who reskilled and created
                                new chapters in their lives and careers. The future jobs revolution is not only for PhD students and computer geeks, it is for everybody.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Rather than read a story, write one.</b> - Ask yourself - what do your life to be?
                                Where do you want to be in 20, 30 years. When your reflecting on your life, what do you
                                want your story and legacy to be?
                                Form your ambitions, create a plan and work towards that plan. Don't drift from day to
                                day.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Be prepared to constantly evolve your skills and knowledge set</b> - Many of the jobs of the future are evolving at such rapid paces that techniques nad technologies become outdated in years or even months. That degree of change requires the ability to
                                learn, not just having a static knowledge set. Russ's career is a great example of this maleability, having been highly effective in a variety of different fields.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Be malleable</b> - Russ's original dream was to work in the Candian defence force, when this was no longer an option he pivoted to engineering. Throughout his career Russ was able to pivot to between any different fields and roles based on the opportunities that presented themselves to him, which ultimately led to a very succesful and fulfilling career. Sometimes having an overly strict plan can restrict yourself from organic opportunities. Be open to these opportunities and be willing to pivot.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>This year will be your healthiest remaining year, statistically</b> - Russ had an amazing career which he was passionate about and proud of, but with having experienced some health issues he decided to prirotise what mattered the most to him, his health and his marriage. We never know what is going to happen or what is around the corner so be willing and disciplined to focus on what matters most to you.
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                            <p>Russ is an accomplished executive leading research, development and implementation of
                                some of the most advanced technologies at one of Australia's largest energy companies -
                                Woodside Energy.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The technologies that Russ has led include IBM Watson, AWS, Autonomous Robotics in
                                collaboration with NASA - along with a broader suite of analytics and artificial
                                intelligence systems. Woodside is benefiting from these technologies through better
                                decision making, operational productivity and safety and capturing over 30 years of
                                corporate knowledge for the generation to come.
