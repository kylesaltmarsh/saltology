                        <p>I am currently working as a robotics engineer at Woodside Energy. Our team is working on
                            deployment of robotic systems across our oil and gas facilities for surveillance and
                            manipulation. Its awesome, reach out if you are interested.</p>

                        </section>
                        <p>As an undergraduate I studied Physics, Applied Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering. I am
                            now (still) writing my thesis for my PhD in submarine vibration for the sonar systems team
                            at Defence Science and Technology for the Australian Navy. Never start work before you
                            finish your PhD, take it from me. Once I have finished my thesis my goal is to publish a
                            paper at ICML in the field of robot learning. </p>

                        </section>
                        <p>I love public speaking for every occasion, except at a funeral. I am lucky to be the
                            president of a <a href=&quot;https://www.rostrum.com.au/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;
                                rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Rostrum</a> public speaking club in Perth, reach out
                            to me if you would like to join. We are a bunch of wierdos, it's great. My goal is to do a
                            TedX talk before I am 30. </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Basketball</b> - Some might say that being white, software development and
                                basketball do not go hand in hand, and they would be right. I am not the best but I love
                                it and I religiously watch the NBA.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Rock climbing</b> - I think rock climbing is the best solo sport someone can do.
                                Good for the body, the mind, overcoming your fears and constantly surprising yourself
                                with what you can achieve. Outdoor trips to date have been Margaret River (Western
                                Australia) and Blue Mountains (New South Whales).
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Magic</b> - This is why I am not good at basketball. They just do not overlap. Card
                                tricks are my thing, I own approximately 40 decks of playing cards.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Stand Up</b> - I do some amateur comedy (very amateur) which is by far the most
                                terrifying thing I do. I love it though, no better feeling than making other people
                                laugh.
                            </li>

                                that leaves you thinking that you have no excuses to not push yourself to your absolute
                                limits to achieve your goals.
                            </li>

                                    Roberts</b> - Many people know the Wealth of Nations, but 16 years earlier Adam
                                smith wrote the Theory of Moral Sentiments because he believed that before he could
                                understand economics, he had to understand people. Love this book and it is amazing how
                                timeless it is.

                                    Kahneman</b> - The best behavioural psychology book I have read. Gives an
                                understanding on how our brains work, why we think and act the way we do, the biases we
                                have and how to be aware of them. He won the Nobel prize for this work so I guess don't
                                take my word for it.

                                my own. He is now Elon Musk's personal blogger and his series on SpaceX, Tesla and
                                Neuralink are awesome.

                                Controversial? Eh, I love Jordan Peterson. Give him 20 minutes of non pre-biased
                                listening and I think it is quite evident that everything he hopes to achieve in life is
                                an elevated level of happiness in as many people that he can.

                            <li> <b>Exercise</b> - My exercise regime is built to focus on rock climbing which includes elements of hangboarding, strength, HIIT and mobility. Due to my intermittent fasting, strength sessions are performed at lunch rather than in the morning to ensure I can eat before and after the session. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Morning: HIIT skipping + deep breathing heart rate training, hangboarding and mobility work (Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri)</li>
