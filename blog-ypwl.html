                    <h1>The Young Persons' World Lecture Competition &mdash; IOM3</h1>

                    <p>In May 2018 I entered and won the Young Persons’ World Lecture Competition, hosted by The Institute of
                        Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) and sponsored by CBMM. This competition sent me on an
                        amazing trip to South Africa to compete
                        against finalists from all over the world, focused on the ability to deliver technical content.
                        I have always wanted to improve my public speaking and this gave me the motivation to put in the
                        work to get better. I have been
                        attending <a href="https://rostrumwa.com.au/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Rostrum</a>'s public speaking classes every Friday since April,
                        which made winning the competition one of my proudest achievements. I have
                        written this blog to share everything I have learnt about conveying technical topics and public
                        speaking in general.</p>

                    <p>As usual, the footnotes like you see here <a href="#" class="footnote-button"

                        These footnotes are slightly more boring <a href="#" class="footnote2-button"

                    <p>It was a Wednesday afternoon, I was checking my university emails, the constant reminder that I
                        am yet to finish writing up my PhD thesis, when something caught my eye.</p>
                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>“The Young Persons’ World Lecture Competition, Win a trip to South Africa”</b></em>

                    <p>Well, my PhD research unfortunately fell outside of these fields, but since I was captivated by
                        the luxurious prize, I read on.</p>

                    <h1>🤔😏</h1>
                    <p>My neurons were starting to fire. I liked presenting, and I didn’t think I was that bad at it
                        either, and hey, if it isn’t based on the technical content itself, who cares if my PhD isn’t in
                        the field, right? I continued to read.

                    <p>This was two days away. I sat back and pondered. Two days was… troublesome to say the least.
                        However, I had one thing going for me - I didn't have anything to lose. So I sent in my
                        application, apologising for the lateness of my
                        entry. The organiser replied quickly - stating I would be the final speaker of the night.</p>
                    <p>It was happening.</p>
                    <p>On the drive home from work, I had another problem to solve, what the hell was I going to talk
                        about? Here is what I knew, most likely the average competitor would be masters or PhD students
                        who were actually conducting research
                        in the field. So, I probably could not win by the merit of my presentation's content. I started
                        to get desperate as I thought of possible parlour tricks and cheap entertainment tactics I could
                        use.</p>
                    <p>But then I had a brainwave.</p>

                    <p>In 2017 I competed in the <a href="https://unearthed.solutions/" target=&quot;_blank&quot;
                            rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Unearthed</a> hackathon. ‘How can sound be used more
                        effectively in the resource industry’. This fit
                        under the umbrella of mining, and it was related to my PhD research, which is in submarine
                        acoustics. It was perfect... well it was the best shot I had. </p>
                    <p>During the hackathon, we addressed the challenge by combining beam forming technology (to extract
                        individual sound sources from noisy environments), signal processing and predictive modeling
                        for the classification of equipment
                        health purely by its sound signature. We tested our solution framework using sounds from
                        Woodside’s fans, for which we had recordings of healthy fans and those with corroded bearings.
                        <a href="#" class="footnote2-button" data-footnote2-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote2 2"
                            rel="footnote2"
                            data-footnote2-content="<p>Details about the hackathon can be found <a href=&quot;http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201705249639/awards-and-prizes/team-ems-takes-home-innovator-award-unearthed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>here</a> and <a href=&quot;https://unearthed.solutions/news/perth-hackathon-unearths-gold-mine-valuable-solutions-newcrest-and-south32&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>here</a>.</p>"><span>2</span></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>So I started throwing together slides, explaining the hackathon, the problem, our solution and
                        all the technical concepts involved. But I needed more, it wasn’t enough. I was currently
                        working on an account at Rio Tinto, developing
                        a natural language processor machine learning model to read and annotate site workers shift
                        logs. I decided to ask some of the Rio Tinto engineers if they knew of any applications of using
                        acoustics on site for condition monitoring.
                        One of the Rio Tinto engineers, gave me the perfect answer.</p>
                    <p><em>RailBam.</em></p>
                    <p>What RailBam does, is it used beam forming, signal processing and predictive modeling (sounds
                        familiar right?) to monitor the acoustic emissions of each wheel of railway vehicles passing at
                        line speed. <a href="#" class="footnote2-button" data-footnote2-identifier="3"
                            alt="See Footnote2 3" rel="footnote2"
                            data-footnote2-content="<p><a href=&quot;https://www.wabtec.com/products/7314/railbam%C2%AE-bearing-acoustic-monitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Here</a> is the link if you are interested, I am not getting commission.</p>"><span>3</span></a>
                    </p>
                    <p>I had mixed emotions about this discovery. The first, was immediate excitation to how perfectly
                        this tied into my presentation. The second, was anger, fueled by the memory of our pitch in the
                        hackathon. The pitch where we showcased
                        the general solution framework and discussed possible applications, without a detailed example
                        of previous successes.</p>
                    <p>But anyway, that was done, and this competition was not. So I stayed up to 1 am on the Thursday
                        night, or Friday morning if you want to be pedantic, and finally finished putting together a
                        presentation I was happy with.</p>
                    <p>It was competition day. I practiced over lunch whilst I ate one of the 50 sausage rolls I had
                        made the week prior.<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="2"
                            alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote"
                            data-footnote-content="<p>During university I decided to start batch making sausage rolls and freezing them for lunches. I started off doing 20 at a time, then 30, then 40. One time I even did 60, but I severely underestimated the time it would take. I spent the hours of 10 PM - 5 AM waking up every to an alarm every 40 minutes to take the last batch out and put the new batch in. I then had to wake up for uni at 7. At least I was well fed.</p>"><span>2</span></a>
                        I ran through my presentation with both my IBM colleague and my Rio Tinto client, individually.
                        I find that running presentations individually widens the line of communication from the
                        listener, which leads to more valuable feedback. People are generally more open and willing to
                        give feedback and criticism in privacy rather than in a group. On my end, I find that I am also
                        more receptive. Beyond that, the obvious advantage is that it also allows
                        you to incorporate the first set of feedback before presenting to your next audience. That being
                        said - I would also say it is very important to take feedback for what it is, optional. Not all
                        feedback is absolute, and it is
                        up to you to listen to the feedback, judge it impartially, and then decide the action to take.
                        One thing I have learnt in gaining feedback for my presentations, is that everyone has their own
                        ideas and preferences for what
                        makes a good presentation, including myself as you are reading this blog. When you try to
                        incorporate all or too much feedback, you may lose your personal identity. To me, a strong sense
                        of personal identity is the most critical
                        part of a presentation. Your personality needs to shine through. You need to be genuine. It is a
                        well known psychological fact that we feel more connected with those who are genuine. This also
                        applies to presenting. In order
                        to establish a real, positive connection with your audience, you need to be genuine. So, seek
                        feedback, but remember, it is up to you to choose how you use it. Now, back to the story. </p>
                    <p>It was 4:30 PM, I was due to start at 5. I left the office in a hurry. As I stepped into my car,
                        I heard a loud rip. I looked down to see that my pants had ripped from my crutch all the way to
                        the back of my bum. I slowly rested
                        my head on the steering wheel. This was a bad omen.</p>

                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em> <b>"What were you thinking Kyle? That you were just going to roll out of bed, win a
                                    competition and have your dream holiday in South Africa? Things don't work that way.
                                    This just was not meant to be. It was a nice fairy tale, but its time to come back
                                    to reality."</b> </em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This continued for about half the drive. Eventually I snapped myself out of it.</p>

                    <p>I arrived at the venue, just as the previous speaker wrapped up their presentation. I was barely
                        seated for 2 minutes before the chair began to introduce me.</p>

                        bungee jump but I still do it anyway - is I tell myself that I am excited. <a href="#"
                            class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="4" alt="See Footnote 4" rel="footnote"
                            data-footnote-content="<p> At the start of the year I went to New Zealand, where I was too scared to do the biggest bungee jump in the southern hemisphere, 140 meters. I regretted not doing it ever since. It just so happened that my South Africa tour included an optional activity - the world's biggest bungee jump, 216 meters. Now, I am not one to believe in fate, but I felt like I had to do it. On the night before I tried to convince myself I was excited, but the fact I didn't get a minute of sleep meant it probably didn't work. <a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0on5Gz9xgUo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Here</a> is the youtube video. </p>"><span>4</span></a>
                        Telling yourself that you are excited is a common psychological ploy. A <a
                            href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/12/performance-anxiety.aspx"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> by the American
                        Psychological Association states that when people tell themselves to get excited, they perform
                        better than they do when they tell themselves to calm down. "When people feel anxious and try to
                        calm down, they are thinking of
                        all the things that could go badly. When they're excited, they're thinking of all the things
                        that could go well".</p>

                    <p>The second, is that force myself to smile. It is also well known that certain actions by the body
                        send messages to receptors in your brain. By smiling, you trick your brain that you are happy,
                        and in turn, you feel happier. I find
                        that this one actually works for me.</p>
                    <p>The third, is that I take a few deep breathes (while still smiling) right before I take the
                        stage. Doing this, relaxes me and makes sure I start off my presentation without rushing.</p>

                    <p>I was up.</p>

                    <p>For my confidence during a presentation, I find that the first 30 seconds of a speech are the
                        most critical. If the first 30 seconds go well, I completely relax into the presentation and
                        flow naturally. If the first 30 seconds
                        do not go well, I find myself starting to panic and then I overthink things. I therefore ensure
                        that I know the first 30 seconds of my presentation down to a tee. This is the only part of the
                        presentation that I 'rote learn'.
                        I find this starts me off on a positive note, and then the rest comes naturally. Perhaps this is
                        a weakness of mine that I need to work on, and that a better presenter may be able to recover
                        better than I do from a bad start.
                        One thing I know is that, this 30 second philosophy of mine became very obvious to me in
                        performing stand-up. When the audience laughed at my opening joke, I went on a roll. When the
                        first joke fell flat, I found it tough to
                        recover for the rest of my set. Anyway - it is something I am working on, but for me currently,
                        I put a lot of effort into making sure the first 30 seconds go perfectly.</p>
                    <p>Now, I am going to breakdown and dissect my entire presentation, giving insights and analysis
                        into the details of the presentation and the effects that they have on the audience.</p>

                    <p>I find that starting off your presentation with an attention grabber is also very important, it
                        can be a story, it can be a question to the audience, an interesting or confronting fact. It
                        does not matter, as long as it is not
                        the usual dull introduction of the title of your presentation. An <a
                            href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> published by TIME magazine in 2015 quoted research
                        from Microsoft implying that humans now have an attention span of just 8 seconds – which is
                        allegedly less than that of a goldfish. What this means is that if you do not capture the
                        attention of your audience at the very start
                        of your presentation, you may lose them entirely.</p>
                    <p>I started my presentation off with a small story.</p>
                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em> <b>"On a mine site, a technician can simply be walking past a piece of equipment and
                                    stop dead in his tracks, because they know that something doesn't sound quite right.
                                    Just from the sound signature alone… the technician has determined that this piece
                                    of equipment may be faulty - and if they are good - they could probably tell you
                                    exactly what is wrong with it. This is the essence of acoustic based condition
                                    monitoring which is the topic of my presentation today."</b> </em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The story does not even have to be an amazing story - as you can tell - to still be interesting.
                        At the end of the story I introduce my topic, but the audience now already has a good feel for
                        the direction I will be taking them
                        in.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 2</h4>
                    <img class="lazy" data-src="images/slides/Slide02.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" height=550px>
                    <p>The next step of my presentation was <em>about me</em>. I am a big fan of having an about me
                        section in your presentation. It humanises you. Depending on what is appropriate for the
                        presentation, I give the audience different details
                        about myself. For this presentation, I focused on my education, my previous work experience and
                        my current role. </p>

                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>"I am from Perth, Australia - fun fact, Perth is the most isolated city in the world.
                                    I studied mechanical engineering, physics and applied mathematics at the University
                                    of Western Australia. I then worked at BHP Billiton, where I thought I would fulfill
                                    an illustrious career as a mechanical engineer. I was there for less than year
                                    however, because I realised that my true passion was solving technical problems. So
                                    I decided to go back to uni to do my PhD in submarine acoustics for the Australian
                                    Navy. Now, you can see that I am a little less happy the second time around and that
                                    is because I am still writing my thesis. But I have entered the professional world
                                    again, working as a Data Scientist for IBM, contracted to Rio Tinto Iron
                                    Ore."</b></em></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>There are three things to note here.</p>
                    <p>The first, is that I have used a Lego theme in my presentation. This may seem childish, but there
                        was a reason for it. The tone I chose set for my entire presentation was fun and light hearted,
                        as I think learning should be. Besides,
                        Everybody likes Lego.</p>
                    <p>The second, is that I usually find speaking about my education and work experience quite dry.
                        Sometimes, it might even be perceived as arrogant. Boasting about your intelligence separates
                        yourself from your audience, which is the
                        opposite effect that should be desired. But for a technical presentation, I felt it was
                        necessary to show that I am credible to lecture on this topic. The combination of my engineering
                        degree and work experience at BHP Billiton
                        qualify me to the audience to present on a mining related topic. My PhD in acoustics qualifies
                        me to talk about the use of sound on mine sites. My current role as a Data Scientist for IBM,
                        but contracted to Rio Tinto, qualifies
                        me to talk about the application of technology in the mining industry.</p>
                    <p>The third, is the use humour. I love using humour in my presentations and I like to do it early.
                        This works to do two extremely important things. 1) disarm and relax the audience 2) disarm and
                        relax myself. The <em>about me</em> section of a presentation is the perfect time to use humour,
                        as I think it is important to adopt a more serious and professional persona for the meat of the
                        presentation. You do not want to be joking around too much whilst
                        you are trying to explain the technical content, this will reduce your credibility in the eyes
                        of the audience. Humour has to be used naturally and you have to understand your audience.
                        Notice the frowning face that I edited
                        onto the Lego man that represents the PhD phase of my education. I knew - from stalking the
                        judging panel on LinkedIn - that many of them held PhDs, or at least did postgraduate study.
                        This meant that they will too understand
                        the pain of working in research. They will relate, and are likely to enjoy the humour, and they
                        did. </p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 3</h4>
                    <img class="lazy" data-src="images/slides/Slide03.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" height=550px>
                    <p>The next part of my presentation was explaining what exactly I was going to be talking about. I
                        find the audience is settled in by this point and ready to listen, but you do not want to scare
                        them off. You have to start off easy
                        to hook them in. I used this slide to do a two things. Explain what acoustic condition
                        monitoring actually is and to further define the scope of the presentation. </p>

                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>"My favourite saying is that sounds tell stories. Now we have already talked about the
                                    example about the on site technician who can simply listen to the equipment sounds
                                    and know if there is a problem, but we actually do this all the time as well. Who
                                    here has ever booked their car in for a service when it started making funny noises?
                                    That is also an example acoustic based condition monitoring. We do this all the
                                    time, with our computers, our refrigerators… even our partners. We know by the way
                                    something sounds, whether there is a problem. But technology can also do this, and
                                    that is what I really want to focus on today."</b></em></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Again, the theme is light, there is some humour, it is relatable. The audience has a good feel
                        for what acoustic based condition monitoring is and they now know the focus will be on using
                        technology to perform it. Also note the
                        use of 'we' and 'our' - I am trying to build upon the connection with the audience.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 4</h4>
                    <img class="lazy" data-src="images/slides/Slide04.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid" height=550px>
                    <p>I then go straight to a real world application, the application of RailBam at Rio Tinto. I do
                        this for two reasons. To give the audience an object to focus their attention on and to showcase
                        the importance of the topic through
                        a real world application. From working in corporate environments, I have learnt to focus my
                        presentations on value. From my experience in academia, the focus is on technical content. I
                        wanted to find a happy middle ground for
                        this presentation. Yes, the competition was based on the ability to explain technical content,
                        however people like to have a story to follow. They need to know why it is important. The
                        audience needs a reason to want to understand
                        the technical content.</p>
                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>"Now, I want to start with an example. Has anyone here heard of RailBam? So a few
                                    years ago, Rio Tinto installed RailBam along their railway line. What RailBam does
                                    is it monitors the condition of the bearings on the wheels of the wagons, just by
                                    the sound signature that they are emitting. So as the train drives past this
                                    juncture that you see here, these boxes use microphones to listen to the sounds of
                                    each of the bearings - as its moving at full speed by the way - to determine the
                                    health of each and every individual bearing. Then it logs the results."</b></em></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>I am deliberately hyping the impressiveness of technology. I deliver this, with genuine
                        enthusiasm, which will be mirrored - either consciously or subconsciously - by the audience.
                        Obviously if I was to deliver this with no enthusiasm,
                        it would be unlikely the audience would find the technology very impressive at all.</p>

                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>"Now, Western Australia is the largest exporter of iron ore in the world and Rio Tinto
                                    owns the largest privately owned railway line in the world. This means that their
                                    trains can be over a two kilometers long. That is hundreds of wagons and thousands
                                    of bearings on a single train! Now, I actually have an audio clip of a train going
                                    by on the rail line. Now I know that some of you might not be bearing experts, but

                        it a chance because you may be positively surprised. I am enticing the audience to believe that
                        they have a genuine chance to achieve
                        the task I am setting for them. This will likely spark their interest and make them listen more

                        encountered in most engineering and science degrees. It was therefore a safe bet that the

                                    these two responses. You can see that it is very easy to see these differences. The
                                    unhealthy bearing shows spikes which are not present in the healthy bearing. This
                                    process is called extracting the acoustical features. We are looking for the
                                    features which allow us to distinguish the difference between the sound from a
                                    healthy bearing and the sound from an unhealthy bearing. So the frequency band from
                                    about 50 to 75 Hz is a perfect example of one of these acoustic features. Another
                                    feature, might be the range from about 115 to 140 Hz, and you keep going. Once you
                                    have got a bunch of these acoustic features, you feed them into a predictive model

                        when you want to direct the audiences
                        attention to particular focal points. Again, I wrap up the module of information by informing

                        sighs and prepares themselves for another one
                        of my ploys. This time however, they are pleasantly surprised as they <em>can</em> detect the

                                    that acoustics is under utilised in the resource industry - which is why they chose
                                    that topic as the challenge. Yes, typical trending methods are used; temperatures,
                                    vibrations and pressures... However, acoustic monitoring has one clear advantage

                        it is one that is shared amongst
                        the industry. I then provide a moonshot example of the potential future of acoustic condition

Kahneman did an experiment where he got a bunch of people to do two experiments; 60 seconds of an ice cold bath and 60 seconds of the same ice cold bath but this time followed by 30 seconds of a very slightly warmer ice bath. Both experiences were not enjoyable, but the second was clearly worse. He then asked the subjects to vote which one they would prefer to do again if they had to. Most of the people chose to do the 90 second ice bath. This was because their memory had over-weighted the experience of the last 30 seconds, which were not as bad as the first 60. This is clearly a bad decision and it was made because of the peak-end rule.

                        is asked that requires going back through your slidedeck, I will look far more prepared and
                        organised. This is just another point that will be tallied in the audience's eyes - and the

                    <p>The second, is the additional slides on the right. I have done this to influence and make
                        suggestions to the audience on the questions they should ask, questions which I am perfectly
                        prepared for. Now, it is worth noting that this
                        did not actually work for me this time - the judges did not fall for my jedi mind tricks - but
                        it has worked in the past and is always worth a shot. </p>

                    <p>When it comes to answering questions, keep it simple and do not try to answer questions if you
                        are not sure. You want to play defensive, you are playing to keep the lead. You have done an
                        awesome presentation, now it is just about
                        not screwing it up. If a question comes your way that you can further impress them, then great.
                        If it doesn't, no problem. What I will say is that you should have weeded out any potential
                        holes or flaws in your presentation
                        by critiquing it yourself, practicing with other people and by laying in bed all night pondering
                        what questions could come up. Prepare for as many possible angles as you can.</p>

                    <p>I always like to save the acknowledgements for last, it is a nice way to exit the stage. If you
                        do them too early, then once the questioning is done you either have to repeat yourself and say
                        thanks again, or just sort of leave
                        the stage without a good sign off. Nobody wants that.</p>

                    </section>

                    <p>I was able to win the national round, scoring the trip to South Africa to represent Australia in
                        the world finals. I was then able to go on to win the international final, becoming the first
                        Australian to ever win the competition.
                    </p>
                    <p>Entering the Young Persons’ Lecture Competition has had a huge positive impact on me. It
                        motivated me to improve at something that I love, which is public speaking. I joined Rostrum
                        with the goal of winning the international final,
                        but I will definitely be staying as I have realised how much there is still to learn. During my
                        trip to South Africa I met some amazing people and made some good friends. Most importantly
                        though, I was able to shock myself
                        with what is possible with hard work and dedication. </p>
                    <p>When I first saw the email I could have quite easily have never given it a second thought.
                        Opportunities come and go, at times there may be obstacles or they might not seem like a perfect
                        fit for you. But at the end of the day
                        you have two choices, to let that opportunity pass by, or to just go for it. </p>

                        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">💡 Key Messages</h1>
                    </section>
                    <p>Here are my presentation quick tips. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Know your audience</b> - Write your content and plan your presentation with your target
                            audience in mind. </li>
                        <li> <b>Keep your slides simple</b> - Minimise the amount of words on your slides as much as
                            possible. Use animations sparingly. Consider applying a theme to the presentation.</li>
                        <li> <b>Before your speech</b> - Tell yourself you are excited, smile and take deep breaths.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>30 Second Rule</b> - Know the first 30 seconds of your speech like the back of your
                            hand.</li>
                        <li> <b>Start with an attention grabber</b> - Avoid textbook introductions, they are boring,
                            just like textbooks. People lose focus quickly so open with a story, ask the audience a
                            thought provoking question or hit them with a confronting
                            fact. </li>
                        <li> <b>Tell the audience about yourself</b> - Sharing details about yourself in an <em>about
                                me</em> section will humanise you and start to develop a connection with your audience.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>Using humour</b> - Know your audience and use humour naturally, do not force it. Choose
                            the appropriate times, early in a presentation is usually a good place for humour.</li>
                        <li> <b>Use 'we', not 'me' and 'you'</b> - Using words such as 'we' and 'us' help to build the
                            connection with your audience. The last thing you want to do - unless you are CEO or other
                            big wig - is create separation between yourself
                            and your audience.</li>
                        <li> <b>Have a story</b> - We all like stories. Giving your presentation a narrative will keep
                            people focused and entertained.</li>
                        <li> <b>Display the emotions you want your audience to feel</b> - If you want your audience to
                            be excited, then be excited yourself.</li>
                        <li> <b>Interact with your audience</b> - Ask questions and think of out-of-the-box ways to
                            deliver key messages.</li>
                        <li> <b>Use signposting</b> - Signposting will help the audience maintain focus as well as
                            helping you remember your content. </li>
                        <li> <b>Make your presentation flow</b> - Put in the time to make sure your content flows from
                            slide to slide. A good presentation flow will keep your audience encapsulated. </li>
                        <li> <b>Use analogies</b> - Analogies are a great way to explain concepts and can also work well
                            to add points of humour or show your understanding of your audience. </li>
                        <li> <b>Use the framing effect </b> - Use the framing effect for the presentation of statistics
                            and results to get your desired impact. </li>
                        <li> <b>Know when to be serious</b> - Enhance the impact of your key messages by knowing when to
                            be serious. </li>
                        <li> <b>Remember the peak-end rule</b> - People overvalue the peak and the end of an experience
                            when remembering it. Use this to your advantage by ensuring you have a strong finish to your
                            presentation. </li>
                        <li> <b>Answering questions</b> - Keep your answers short and sweet, do not pretend to know what
                            you do not and use additional slides to influence which questions you get asked.</li>
                        <li> <b>Thanking the audience and acknowledgements</b> - Thank your audience and make your
                            acknowledgements right before you exit the stage. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Remember, no matter what you are presenting or speaking about, you are there to inform, persuade
                        and entertain. <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="9"
