                        <p>In May 2018 I entered the Young Persons’ World Lecture Competition, hosted by The Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) and sponsored by CBMM. This competition sent me on an amazing trip to South Africa to compete
                            against finalists from all over the world, focused on the ability to deliver technical content. I have always wanted to improve my public speaking and this gave me the motivation to put in the work to get better. I have been
                            attending <a href="https://rostrumwa.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rostrum</a>'s public speaking classes every Friday since April, which made winning the competition one of my proudest achievements. I have
                            written this blog to share everything I have learnt about conveying technical topics and public speaking in general. Let's dive into it.</p>

                        <p>It was a Wednesday afternoon, I was checking my university emails, the constant reminder that I am yet to finish writing up my PhD thesis, when something caught my eye.</p>
                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em><b>“The Young Persons’ World Lecture Competition, Win a trip to South Africa”</b></em></p>

                        <p>Well, my PhD research unfortunately fell outside of these fields, but since I was captivated by the luxurious prize, I read on.</p>
                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">

                        <p>My neurons were starting to fire. I liked presenting, and I didn’t think I was that bad at it either, and hey, if it isn’t based on the technical content itself, who cares if my PhD isn’t in the field, right? I continued to read.
                        </p>
                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">

                        <p>This was two days away. I sat back and pondered. Two days was… troublesome to say the least. However, I had one thing going for me - I didn't have anything to lose. So I sent in my application, apologising for the lateness of my
                            entry. The organiser replied quickly - stating I would be the final speaker of the night.</p>
                        <p>It was happening.</p>
                        <p>On the drive home from work, I had another problem to solve, what the hell was I going to talk about? Here is what I knew, most likely the average competitor would be masters or PhD students who were actually conducting research
                            in the field. So, I probably could not win by the merit of my presentation's content. I started to get desperate as I thought of possible parlour tricks and cheap entertainment tactics I could use.</p>
                        <p>But then I had a brainwave.</p>

                        <p>In 2017 I competed in the <a href="https://unearthed.solutions/" target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Unearthed</a> hackathon. ‘How can sound be used more effectively in the resource industry’. This fit
                            under the umbrella of mining, and it was related to my PhD research, which is in submarine acoustics. It was perfect... well it was the best shot I had. </p>
                        <p>During the hackathon, we addressed the challenge by combining beam forming technology (to extract individual sound sources from noisy environments), signal processing and predictive modelling for the classification of equipment
                            health purely by its sound signature. We tested our solution framework using sounds from Woodside’s fans, for which we had recordings of healthy fans and those with corroded bearings. <a href="#" class="footnote2-button" data-footnote2-identifier="1"
                                alt="See Footnote2 1" rel="footnote2" data-footnote2-content="<p>Details about the hackathon can be found <a href=&quot;http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201705249639/awards-and-prizes/team-ems-takes-home-innovator-award-unearthed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>here</a> and <a href=&quot;https://unearthed.solutions/news/perth-hackathon-unearths-gold-mine-valuable-solutions-newcrest-and-south32&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>here</a>.</p>"><span>1</span></a>
                        </p>
                        <p>So I started throwing together slides, explaining the hackathon, the problem, our solution and all the technical concepts involved. But I needed more, it wasn’t enough. I was currently working on an account at Rio Tinto, developing
                            a natural language processor machine learning model to read and annotate site workers shift logs. I decided to ask some of the Rio Tinto engineers if they knew of any applications of using acoustics on site for condition monitoring.
                            One of the Rio Tinto engineers, gave me the perfect answer.</p>
                        <p><em>RailBam.</em></p>
                        <p>What RailBam does, is it used beam forming, signal processing and predictive modelling (sounds familiar right?) to monitor the acoustic emissions of each wheel of railway vehicles passing at line speed. <a href="#" class="footnote2-button"
                                data-footnote2-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote2 2" rel="footnote2" data-footnote2-content="<p><a href=&quot;https://www.wabtec.com/products/7314/railbam%C2%AE-bearing-acoustic-monitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Here</a> is the link if you are interested, I am not getting commission.</p>"><span>2</span></a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I had mixed emotions about this discovery. The first, was immediate excitation to how perfectly this tied into my presentation. The second, was anger, fuelled by the memory of our pitch in the hackathon. The pitch where we showcased
                            the general solution framework and discussed possible applications, without a detailed example of previous successes.</p>
                        <p>But anyway, that was done, and this competition was not. So I stayed up to 1 am on the Thursday night, or Friday morning if you want to be pedantic, and finally finished putting together a presentation I was happy with.</p>
                        <p>It was competition day. I practiced over lunch whilst I ate one of the 50 sausage rolls I had made the week prior.<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="1" alt="See Footnote 1" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>During university I decided to start batch making sausage rolls and freezing them for lunches. I started off doing 20 at a time, then 30, then 40. One time I even did 60, but I severely underestimated the time it would take. I spent the hours of 10 PM - 5 AM waking up every to an alarm every 40 minutes to take the last batch out and put the new batch in. I then had to wake up for uni at 7. At least I was well fed.</p>"><span>1</span></a>                            I ran through my presentation with both my IBM colleague and my Rio Tinto client, individually. I find that running presentations individually widens the line of communication from the listener, which leads to more valuable
                            feedback. People are generally more open and willing to give feedback and criticism in privacy rather than in a group. On my end, I find that I am also more receptive. Beyond that, the obvious advantage is that it also allows
                            you to incorporate the first set of feedback before presenting to your next audience. That being said - I would also say it is very important to take feedback for what it is, optional. Not all feedback is absolute, and it is
                            up to you to listen to the feedback, judge it impartially, and then decide the action to take. One thing I have learnt in gaining feedback for my presentations, is that everyone has their own ideas and preferences for what
                            makes a good presentation, including myself as you are reading this blog. When you try to incorporate all or too much feedback, you may lose your personal identity. To me, a strong sense of personal identity is the most critical
                            part of a presentation. Your personality needs to shine through. You need to be genuine. It is a well known psychological fact that we feel more connected with those who are genuine. This also applies to presenting. In order
                            to establish a real, positive connection with your audience, you need to be genuine. So, seek feedback, but remember, it is up to you to choose how you use it. Now, back to the story. </p>
                        <p>It was 4:30 PM, I was due to start at 5. I left the office in a hurry. As I stepped into my car, I heard a loud rip. I looked down to see that my pants had ripped from my crutch all the way to the back of my bum. I slowly rested
                            my head on the steering wheel. This was a bad omen.</p>

                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em> <b>"What were you thinking Kyle? That you were just going to roll out of bed, win a competition and have your dream holiday in South Africa? Things dont work that way. This just was not meant to be. It was a nice fairy tale, but its time to come back to reality."</b>  </em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>This continued for about half the drive. Eventually I snapped myself out of it.</p>

                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em> <b>"Okay that's enough of that. You’ve come this far, you’re not going to let a rip in your pants derail this whole operation Kyle." <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p> I talk to myself a fair bit actually, it keeps me sane.</p>"><span>2</span></a></b>  </em></p>
                        </div>



                        <p>I arrived at the venue, just as the previous speaker wrapped up their presentation. I was barely seated for 2 minutes before the chair began to introduce me.</p>
                        <p>Now, There are a three things I like to do before I present. </p>
                        <p>The first - which I am not entirely sure really works for me after doing the world's biggest bungee jump but I still do it anyway - is I tell myself that I am excited. <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="3"
                                alt="See Footnote 3" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p> At the start of the year I went to New Zealand, where I was too scared to do the biggest bungee jump in the southern hemisphere, 140 meters. I regretted not doing it ever since. It just so happened that my South Africa tour included an optional activity - the world's biggest bungee jump, 216 meters. Now, I am not one to believe in fate, but I felt like I had to do it. On the night before I tried to convince myself I was excited, but the fact I didn't get a minute of sleep meant it probably didn't work. <a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0on5Gz9xgUo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Here</a> is the youtube video. </p>"><span>3</span></a>
                            Telling yourself that you are excited is a common psychological ploy. A <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/12/performance-anxiety.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> by the American
                            Psychological Association states that when people tell themselves to get excited, they perform better than they do when they tell themselves to calm down. "When people feel anxious and try to calm down, they are thinking of
                            all the things that could go badly. When they're excited, they're thinking of all the things that could go well".</p>

                        <p>The second, is that force myself to smile. It is also well known that certain actions by the body send messages to receptors in your brain. By smiling, you trick your brain that you are happy, and in turn, you feel happier. I find
                            that this one actually works for me.</p>
                        <p>The third, is that I take a few deep breathes (while still smiling) right before I take the stage. Doing this, relaxes me and makes sure I start off my presentation without rushing.</p>

                        <p>I was up.</p>

                        <p>For my confidence during a presentation, I find that the first 30 seconds of a speech are the most critical. If the first 30 seconds go well, I completely relax into the presentation and flow naturally. If the first 30 seconds
                            do not go well, I find myself starting to panic and then I overthink things. I therefore ensure that I know the first 30 seconds of my presentation down to a tee. This is the only part of the presentation that I 'rote learn'.
                            I find this starts me off on a positive note, and then the rest comes naturally. Perhaps this is a weakness of mine that I need to work on, and that a better presenter may be able to recover better than I do from a bad start.
                            One thing I know is that, this 30 second philosophy of mine became very obvious to me in performing stand-up. When the audience laughed at my opening joke, I went on a roll. When the first joke fell flat, I found it tough to
                            recover for the rest of my set. Anyway - it is something I am working on, but for me currently, I put a lot of effort into making sure the first 30 seconds go perfectly.</p>
                        <p>Now, I am going to breakdown and dissect my entire presentation, giving insights and analysis into the details of the presentation and the effects that they have on the audience.</p>

                        <p>I find that starting off your presentation with an attention grabber is also very important, it can be a story, it can be a question to the audience, an interesting or confronting fact. It does not matter, as long as it is not
                            the usual dull introduction of the title of your presentation. An <a href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> published by TIME magazine in 2015 quoted research
                            from Microsoft implying that humans now have an attention span of just 8 seconds – which is allegedly less than that of a goldfish. What this means is that if you do not capture the attention of your audience at the very start
                            of your presentation, you may lose them entirely.</p>
                        <p>I started my presentation off with a small story.</p>
                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em> <b>"On a mine site, a technician can simply be walking past a piece of equipment and stop dead in his tracks, because they know that something doesn't sound quite right. Just from the sound signature alone… the technician has determined that this piece of equipment may be faulty - and if they are good - they could probably tell you exactly what is wrong with it. This is the essence of acoustic based condition monitoring which is the topic of my presentation today."</b>  </em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The story does not even have to be an amazing story - as you can tell - to still be interesting. At the end of the story I introduce my topic, but the audience now already has a good feel for the direction I will be taking them
                            in.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 2</h4>
                        <img src="images/slides/Slide02.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>The next step of my presentation was <em>about me</em>. I am a big fan of having an about me section in your presentation. It humanises you. Depending on what is appropriate for the presentation, I give the audience different details
                            about myself. For this presentation, I focused on my education, my previous work experience and my current role. </p>

                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em><b>"I am from Perth, Australia - fun fact, Perth is the most isolated city in the world. I studied mechanical engineering, physics and applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia. I then worked at BHP Billiton, where I thought I would fulfill an illustrious career as a mechanical engineer. I was there for less than year however, because I realised that my true passion was solving technical problems. So I decided to go back to uni to do my PhD in submarine acoustics for the Australian Navy. Now, you can see that I am a little less happy the second time around and that is because I am still writing my thesis. But I have entered the professional world again, working as a Data Scientist for IBM, contracted to Rio Tinto Iron Ore."</b></em></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>There are three things to note here.</p>
                        <p>The first, is that I have used a Lego theme in my presentation. This may seem childish, but there was a reason for it. The tone I chose set for my entire presentation was fun and light hearted, as I think learning should be. Besides,
                            Everybody likes Lego.</p>
                        <p>The second, is that I usually find speaking about my education and work experience quite dry. Sometimes, it might even be perceived as arrogant. Boasting about your intelligence separates yourself from your audience, which is the
                            opposite effect that should be desired. But for a technical presentation, I felt it was necessary to show that I am credible to lecture on this topic. The combination of my engineering degree and work experience at BHP Billiton
                            qualify me to the audience to present on a mining related topic. My PhD in acoustics qualifies me to talk about the use of sound on mine sites. My current role as a Data Scientist for IBM, but contracted to Rio Tinto, qualifies
                            me to talk about the application of technology in the mining industry.</p>
                        <p>The third, is the use humour. I love using humour in my presentations and I like to do it early. This works to do two extremely important things. 1) disarm and relax the audience 2) disarm and relax myself. The <em>about me</em>                            section of a presentation is the perfect time to use humour, as I think it is important to adopt a more serious and professional persona for the meat of the presentation. You do not want to be joking around too much whilst
                            you are trying to explain the technical content, this will reduce your credibility in the eyes of the audience. Humour has to be used naturally and you have to understand your audience. Notice the frowning face that I edited
                            onto the Lego man that represents the PhD phase of my education. I knew - from stalking the judging panel on LinkedIn - that many of them held PhDs, or at least did postgraduate study. This meant that they will too understand
                            the pain of working in research. They will relate, and are likely to enjoy the humour, and they did. </p>

                        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 3</h4>
                        <img src="images/slides/Slide03.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>The next part of my presentation was explaining what exactly I was going to be talking about. I find the audience is settled in by this point and ready to listen, but you do not want to scare them off. You have to start off easy
                            to hook them in. I used this slide to do a two things. Explain what acoustic condition monitoring actually is and to further define the scope of the presentation. </p>

                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em><b>"My favourite saying is that sounds tell stories. Now we have already talked about the example about the on site technician who can simply listen to the equipment sounds and know if there is a problem, but we actually do this all the time as well. Who here has ever booked their car in for a service when it started making funny noises? That is also an example acoustic based condition monitoring. We do this all the time, with our computers, our refrigerators… even our partners. We know by the way something sounds, whether there is a problem. But technology can also do this, and that is what I really want to focus on today."</b></em></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Again, the theme is light, there is some humour, it is relatable. The audience has a good feel for what acoustic based condition monitoring is and they now know the focus will be on using technology to perform it. Also note the
                            use of 'we' and 'our' - I am trying to build upon the connection with the audience.</p>
                        <!-- <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="6" alt="See Footnote 6" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>The joke about using acoustic based condition monitoring on our partners actually made me lose my train of thought because the photographer in the audience started laughing.</p>"><span>6</span></a> -->

                        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 4</h4>
                        <img src="images/slides/Slide04.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>I then go straight to a real world application, the application of RailBam at Rio Tinto. I do this for two reasons. To give the audience an object to focus their attention on and to showcase the importance of the topic through
                            a real world application. From working in corporate environments, I have learnt to focus my presentations on value. From my experience in academia, the focus is on technical content. I wanted to find a happy middle ground for
                            this presentation. Yes, the competition was based on the ability to explain technical content, however people like to have a story to follow. They need to know why it is important. The audience needs a reason to want to understand
                            the technical content.</p>
                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em><b>"Now, I want to start with an example. Has anyone here heard of RailBam? So a few years ago, Rio Tinto installed RailBam along their railway line. What RailBam does is it monitors the condition of the bearings on the wheels of the wagons, just by the sound signature that they are emitting. So as the train drives past this juncture that you see here, these boxes use microphones to listen to the sounds of each of the bearings - as its moving at full speed by the way - to determine the health of each and every individual bearing. Then it logs the results."</b></em></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>I am deliberately hyping the impressiveness of technology. I deliver this, with genuine enthusiasm, which will be mirrored - either consciously or subconsciously - by the audience. Obviously if I was to deliver this with no enthusiasm,
                            it would be unlikely the audience would find the technology very impressive at all.</p>

                        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                            <p><em><b>"Now, Western Australia is the largest exporter of iron ore in the world and Rio Tinto owns the largest privately owned railway line in the world. This means that their trains can be over a two kilometers long. That is hundreds of wagons and thousands of bearings on a single train! Now, I actually have an audio clip of a train going by on the rail line. Now I know that some of you might not be bearing experts, but you know, we did just establish that we are all naturals at acoustic based condition monitoring, so I want you to just take a listen, and tell me what you hear."</b></em></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Here I am saying yes I know that you may think you do not know much about bearings, but just give it a chance because you may be positively surprised. I am enticing the audience to believe that they have a genuine chance to achieve
                            the task I am setting for them. This will likely spark their interest and make them listen more attentively, as they take on the challenge. We all like a good challenge. <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="4"
                                alt="See Footnote 4" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p> I stole this technique from one of my <a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>favourite Ted Talks</a> on procrastination by Tim Urban.

                        </div>
                        <p>When I ask the audience who heard the noise, I am revealing to them that they were not suppose to hear it at all. I then say .. its okay, me either. This is important, by grouping myself with the audience, we are in it together.
                            This helps to further build upon the connection. This then segways to my next slide.</p>

                        <p>I am further hyping the impressibility and building the curiosity, as well as narrowing down the problem statement to a single sentence.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I address the problem directly. By this point, the audience wants me to explain. They are ready and they want to learn. By stating the number of steps, I am preparing to use the <a href="http://publicspeakingpower.com/what-is-a-signpost-in-public-speaking/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signposting</a> technique to help maintain the audiences engagement through the technical content. By segmenting the solution into steps, the technical concepts can be explained in
                            manageable blocks of information. This also gives the audience a reference point. They will now have a feel for how close they are to understanding the full picture. This reduces the risk of losing the audience by them not
                            knowing how long the technical concepts might drag on for.</p>

But when you having an array of microphones, like you see on right, then it allows you to do something very special. It allows you to focus in - like an acoustical laser - in a specific direction. By applying phase differences between each of the microphones, you can sum the constructive and destructive interference to amplify the sound from the desired source.

                        <p>I have kept my slides simple. I explain the general concept of beamforming, but I do not get stuck into the weeds. Explaining the intricacies of beamforming offers no value to the overall presentation. It is important to pick your
                            battles.

We are looking for the features which allow us to distinguish the difference between the sound from a healthy bearing and the sound from an unhealthy bearing.

                        <p>Here I used animations to show the acoustic features as I spoke about them. I generally avoid using animations as they can be distracting and unprofessional, but they can be useful to time when you want to direct the audiences
                            attention to particular focal points. Again, I wrap up the module of information by informing the audience that we are about to start the final step.</p>

Now the inputs to the neural network would be the acoustic features that we just picked and the output would be the health of the bearing.

However, acoustic monitoring has one clear advantage over all of these, which is that it does not require direct contact with the equipment being monitored. What is taking off in in Western Australia right now, is the use of robotics and drones on site. Woodside now even has a partnership with NASA.

                        <p>Okay this was my last joke, but to be fair it is a pun so it doesn't really count because it isn't that funny, but it is actually really important. See, as humans, we do not have a very good way of remembering experiences. Our
                            brains overweight two aspects of an experience; the peak and the ending. <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="7" alt="See Footnote 7" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>This is from the book <a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com.au/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Thinking Fast and Slow</a>, written by Daniel Kahneman who won the Nobel Prize for his contributions to the psychology of judgement and decision making. Kahneman did an experiment where he got a bunch of people to do two experiments; 60 seconds of an ice cold bath and 60 seconds of the same ice cold bath but this time followed by 30 seconds of a very slightly warmer ice bath. Both experiences were not enjoyable, but the second was clearly worse. He then asked the subjects to vote which one they would prefer to do again if they had to. Most of the people chose to do the 90 second ice bath. This was because their memory had over-weighted the experience of the last 30 seconds, which were not as bad as the first 60. This is clearly a bad decision and it was made because of the peak-end rule. The peak-end rule can be found <a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@officialroshanb/two-selves-with-in-us-9e7d09f7af2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>here</a>.</p>"><span>7</span></a>

                            is asked that requires going back through your slidedeck, I will look far more prepared and organised. This is just another point that will be tallied in the audience's eyes - and the judging panel in my case. Nothing is worse

                            not screwing it up. If a question comes your way that you can further impress them, then great. If it doesn't, no problem. What I will say is that you should have weeded out any potential holes or flaws in your presentation
                            by critiquing it yourself, practicing with other people and by laying in bed all night pondering what questions could come up. Prepare for as many possible angles as you can.</p>

                        <p>Entering the Young Persons’ Lecture Competition has had a huge positive impact on me. It motivated me to improve at something that I love, which is public speaking. I joined Rostrum with the goal of winning the international final,
                            but I will definitely be staying as I have realised how much there is still to learn. During my trip to South Africa I met some amazing people and made some good friends. Most importantly though, I was able to shock myself
                            with what is possible with hard work and dedication. </p>
                        <p>When I first saw the email I could have quite easily have never given it a second thought. Opportunities come and go, at times there may be obstacles or they might not seem like a perfect fit for you. But at the end of the day
                            you have two choices, to let that opportunity pass by, or to just go for it. </p>

                        </section>
                        <p>Here is my presentation quick tips. </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Know your audience</b> - Write your content and plan your presentation with your target audience in mind. </li>
                            <li> <b>Keep your slides simple</b> - Minimise the amount of words on your slides as much as possible. Use animations sparingly. Consider applying a theme to the presentation.</li>
                            <li> <b>Before your speech</b> - Tell yourself you are excited, smile and take deep breaths.</li>
                            <li> <b>30 Second Rule</b> - Know the first 30 seconds of your speech like the back of your hand.</li>
                            <li> <b>Start with an attention grabber</b> - Avoid textbook introductions, they are boring, just like textbooks. People lose focus quickly so open with a story, ask the audience a thought provoking question or hit them with a confronting
                                fact. </li>
                            <li> <b>Tell the audience about yourself</b> - Sharing details about yourself in an <em>about me</em> section will humanise you and start to develop a connection with your audience.</li>
                            <li> <b>Using humour</b> - Know your audience and use humour naturally, do not force it. Choose the appropriate times, early in a presentation is usually a good place for humour.</li>
                            <li> <b>Use 'we', not 'me' and 'you'</b> - Using words such as 'we' and 'us' help to build the connection with your audience. The last thing you want to do - unless you are CEO or other big wig - is create separation between yourself
                                and your audience.</li>
                            <li> <b>Have a story</b> - We all like stories. Giving your presentation a narrative will keep people focused and entertained.</li>
                            <li> <b>Display the emotions you want your audience to feel</b> - If you want your audience to be excited, then be excited yourself.</li>
                            <li> <b>Interact with your audience</b> - Ask questions and think of out-of-the-box ways to deliver key messages.</li>
                            <li> <b>Use signposting</b> - Signposting will help the audience maintain focus as well as helping you remember your content. </li>
                            <li> <b>Make your presentation flow</b> - Put in the time to make sure your content flows from slide to slide. A good presentation flow will keep your audience encapsulated. </li>
                            <li> <b>Use analogies</b> - Analogies are a great way to explain concepts and can also work well to add points of humour or show your understanding of your audience. </li>
                            <li> <b>Use the framing effect </b> - Use the framing effect for the presentation of statistics and results to get your desired impact. </li>
                            <li> <b>Know when to be serious</b> - Enhance the impact of your key messages by knowing when to be serious. </li>
                            <li> <b>Remember the peak-end rule</b> - People overvalue the peak and the end of an experience when remembering it. Use this to your advantage by ensuring you have a strong finish to your presentation. </li>
                            <li> <b>Answering questions</b> - Keep your answers short and sweet, do not pretend to know what you do not and use additional slides to influence which questions you get asked.</li>
                            <li> <b>Thanking the audience and acknowledgements</b> - Thank your audience and make your acknowledgements right before you exit the stage. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Remember, no matter what you are presenting or speaking about, you are there to inform, persuade and entertain. <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="8" alt="See Footnote 8" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>Hope you enjoyed.</p>"><span>8</span></a></p>
