                        <h1>Dr. Dario Gil &mdash; Director of IBM Research</h1>


                        <p>During THINK I sat in on the opening presentation for quantum computing, presented by the
                            director of IBM Research, Dario Gil. Dario had a certain charisma which made me very quickly
                            say to myself "I have to interview him". I waited all of about 5 minutes before getting out
                            my laptop and sending him an email. His assistant agreed to slot in some time later that
                            afternoon, perfect. The interview was smack in the middle of the conference, so this
                            installment will only have the textual version of the interview. Dario is a great guy, very
                            easy to talk to and gives off a great energy. Dario's extensive experience in leading
                            technical teams, coupled with his charisma, passion for people and strong moral compass will
                            make him a perfect fit for the new director of IBM research. Enjoy the podcast!</p>

                                        would be your favorite hobby, your favourite movie and your favorite food?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well 1 and 3 are connected, my favorite hobby is cooking
                                        for sure. I grew up in Madrid, Spain. So my family is huge into cooking, we cook
                                        and when we're eating we talk about food and about what the next meal will be
                                        haha. So anyways I like to cook, I really like to do many different kinds of
                                        rice dishes from the southeast of Spain where my family is from</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Awesome</div>
                                    <div class="message from">And my favorite movie is The Godfather</div>

                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. I like first one. Part 2 I like very much too</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So, you went MIT to do your PhD in electrical engineering.
                                        Looking back on it you, what made you decide to do a PhD?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well when I was an undergraduate I really got interested
                                        in nanotechnology of all things. I got fascinated by small things that I
                                        couldn't see. I had the benefit of working with a professor who started
                                        inspiring me and so I did some summer internship positions doing research. And
                                        as I got into it I loved the idea of doing independent work and getting really
                                        sophisticated about it. So I just wanted to continue, I wanted to keep studying,
                                        I got the bug of research. I loved trying to discover new things because as an
                                        undergraduate you're very focused on the learning and less on the applying it to
                                        to do something interesting. So I thought I just want to continue doing this and
                                        once I decided I never looked back. I never thought about it again. I said
                                        that's what I'm going to do once I make a decision, thats it</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Well that was my next question, was that the point that you
                                        decided that research was wanted to do for your career then?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well I decided that I wanted to go to grad school, then
                                        after that you never know right? When most people go to grad school they think
                                        that they're going to become a professor in academia. Then as you go into it you
                                        see what it means to be a professor you know, there are plusses and there are
                                        minuses. So at some point I decided that I loved research and I wanted to
                                        continue doing it, but I just wanted to go outside. I didn't want to do it in
                                        academia. There's not that many extraordinary research organizations in
                                        industrial sector, IBM is arguably the finest and so that was my dream and I
                                        said that's what I want to do. I want to go there</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So you just wanted to work in a research environment that
                                        had more business outcomes?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yes, that and to be able to create things and have broader
                                        impact. I liked the teaching dimension but I wanted to see things through and
                                        not just be in the initial loop you know? <a href="#" class="footnote-button"
                                            data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote"

                                        Then the second dimension was that I
                                        was in the world of nano fabrication and lithography <a href="#"
                                            class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="3" alt="See Footnote 3"
                                            rel="footnote"
                                            data-footnote-content="<p>So lithography is actually an ancient greek word that means something like creating art with ink and stone, but I am pretty sure he was doing photolithography, which is the making of printed circuits. Photolithography works kinda like photography, in which the desired pattern of the circuit is printed by dispersing light through a lens onto photoresist</p>"><span>3</span></a>
                                        - making small things - and the most advanced work happens in industry - with
                                        Moore's Law and making chips - you just cannot do it at that scale in academia.
                                        So I wanted to have that industry experience and then once I got into IBM, over
                                        time I saw all the great things you can accomplish and so you know, I stayed
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">Haha well who could blame you. So tell us about your first
                                        role when you first came in, how did you start?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I was hired as an individual technical contributor in a
                                        group called the Advanced Lithography group, which is a mechanism by which you
                                        can print the circuits that go into semiconductor chip and is the reason why we
                                        have Moore's Law. So when I started there I got assigned to the next generation
                                        of lithography systems and then two months after they asked me to look into this
                                        obscure new approach to making chips and so I said sure, that sounds pretty
                                        interesting. So I was lucky enough that a number of months later, the mainstream
                                        approach sort of died and the thing that I was working on became the mainstream
                                        method, immersion lithography <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="4" alt="See Footnote 4" rel="footnote"data-footnote-content="<p>Okay, here we go. So immersion lithography is basically like photolithography except they add a really thin layer of liquid between the lens and the photoresist. The refractive index of the liquid allows a higher resolution which means that feature sizes as small as 45 nanometers can be printed onto the circuits! That's the last lithography I have to look up I swear. Pretty cool though</p>"><span>4</span></a>. So doing this particular
                                        technique, I started to
                                        work with this company in the Netherlands called ASML <a href="#"
                                        class="footnote2-button" data-footnote2-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote2 2"
                                        rel="footnote2"
                                        data-footnote2-content="<p>ASML is a Dutch company and currently the largest supplier in the world of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry</p>"><span>2</span></a>. I led the team that built
                                        the world's first microprocessor with immersion lithography and now that's how
                                        every chip in the world is made. So I was like lucky in some way that I was the
                                        new guy working on this stuff that other people didn't want to work on haha

                                    <div class="message from">I've only worked in the United States. So after I finished
                                        my the in 2003, 3 weeks later I joined IBM. And it was a tough year because I
                                        moved and then not long after I had my first daughter, so she's 16 years old
                                        now. So I went from grad school to IBM, moving into a new house, a new kid, a
                                        new job. It's too much haha I don't recommend it to anybody. Too many things
                                        haha</div>

                                        So would you be able to talk through your journey from that first role to where
                                        you are today?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So actually when I joined, I didn't really like it. It was
                                        kind of tough because when I was in grad school I had my own lab, I had a lot of
                                        autonomy, I could order whatever I wanted, do whatever I wanted, I was happy.
                                        Then I came into IBM and it was tough right? All these rules and mechanisms to
                                        learn, I didn't know how everything worked, so it took me a little bit to figure
                                        out - how do I get things done here? So one of the things that helped me
                                        discover that I wanted to be a leader was when I started working with the
                                        outside, like this company in the Netherlands, ASML. I started to appreciate the
                                        amount of respect that others had for IBM. And even though I didn't understand
                                        it yet, I started to think wow well there must be a lot of good stuff going on
                                        here. So I started getting to know more people, connecting with other scientists
                                        in Almaden, starting to work together and I soon discovered that I enjoyed that
                                        aspect of leadership a lot, bringing teams together to accomplish a goal. So
                                        once we enabled the success of that project I said - this is really for me, this
                                        is what I want to do, I want to lead technical teams. So I had an awesome senior
                                        manager at the time and he really believed in me and he said you know we have
                                        this manager position that's opened up and you've only been here a year but we
                                        believe in you</div>
                                    <div class="message to">This was after your first year?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yes</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Wow</div>
                                    <div class="message from">And so I became a manager a year later and I was like wow,
                                        this is fantastic. So ever since then I've been always been given wonderful
                                        opportunities to continue to progress. I did that and then later I became a
                                        senior manager and I started to get more responsibility. So another key moment
                                        for me, IBM has a wonderful program - particularly salient in the research
                                        division - called the technical assistant program. These are rotational
                                        assignments where you get to spend a year shadowing somebody and learning. And I
                                        did that with the vice president of science and technology. This was six years
                                        into working at IBM. That was transformative for me because I got to see how the
                                        plane is flown you know? I got to see all these different dimensions. So I went
                                        from there, leaving my science, technology and physical sciences background and
                                        going into a totally new area. I went into smart grids. This was at the time
                                        that smart planet was launched, and so I went into that group to become a
                                        manager with two people, in this totally new area. So I took that and we grew
                                        it. I was tasking risks and by going somewhere else new I kept having different
                                        experiences. So at the beginning of my IBM career I used to be the nano guy or
                                        the lithography guy, then the science and technology guy, then the energy guy
                                        and then after a while and I was no longer defined by any of that. People
                                        started seeing me differently, they started just seeing me as a good technical
                                        person. A good scientist that can leap across different areas. So then ever
                                        since then I have had many many roles leading all the different fields and
                                        aspects of research. So I think it was this that eventually allowed me to get to
                                        the current position</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Congratulations by the way</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Thank you. Thank you</div>
                                    <div class="message to">What was that transition like, going from being highly
                                        technical to managerial and overviewing a wide range of different areas?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well in the dimension of management first and foremost
                                        you've got to like people. You've got to care about them, really you're there
                                        for them. I mean my role as a manager and a leader is just to serve the
                                        scientists and the researchers, they are the ones that do all the work. So first
                                        you start with that and then I think there is a methodology to conduct projects
                                        successfully. I think there are 4 dimensions that are really important. Number 1
                                        is that you have to inspire people - where are we going? You've got to have a
                                        vision and you have to communicate and be able to articulate where the team is
                                        going. The second aspect is the ability to build teams, to be able to select the
                                        right people and bring them together. The third dimension, you've got to give
                                        them an infrastructure to succeed. So for example, if you are in the world of
                                        quantum computing they've got to have cryostats, laboratories and fabrication.
                                        You've got to give them the resources to succeed. Fourthly, you've got to have a
                                        sustainable business model. You have got to pay the bills, it has to work. Now
                                        it sounds very obvious that you need those 4 things but many many people I see
                                        do a few of them but not all 4. They have a wonderful vision, but a poor team or
                                        they have a great team and no vision, a vision and a team but no money. You need
                                        all 4, doesn't matter whether the project is small or big. My view is that this
                                        methodology works. So that's a lesson I learned when I was doing my TA rotation
                                        assignment and I've applied it ever since. Think about those dimensions and if
                                        you are spending your time making sure you are doing all of them. That is my
                                        recipe</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Well cooking is your favourite hobby haha. There's obviously
                                        so much exciting research going on right now, is there a field that really
                                        fascinates you in particular?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well I would say the field of artificial intelligence in
                                        general, the opportunity to be able to create capability to make progress
                                        against that goal is phenomenal. AI, it's just one of the grandest things we
                                        could imagine right? But what motivates me is to achieve it in the context of
                                        helping people. I am a very humanistic person, I like technology but in the end
                                        I really feel very strongly that we are at the center of this all and technology
                                        is just a tool to help us. So it needs to be grounded in that philosophy. So I
                                        feel very strongly about that idea, Ginni talks a lot about stewardship and the
                                        importance of doing this in a thoughtful fashion for the world. So I'm
                                        fascinated by AI, I also love quantum. I love it intellectually, I love
                                        technically, I just love it</div>
                                    <div class="message to">It's been a recurring theme, a lot of people that I have
                                        spoken to have said quantum is what they are most excited about</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I just think it is one of those things that only happens
                                        every 50 years. It's just an amazing moment in history that we are in and the
                                        team is phenomenal</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yes! When you put the long span of human history into

                                    <div class="message from">Yes exactly, and even in other areas. I admire and am
                                        incredibly fascinated about what's happening in biology. Computational biology
                                        and genomics and the implications it will have is absolutely incredible. So I
                                        think that intersection of quantum, physics, biology and the world of
                                        mathematics and artificial intelligence will be absolutely transformative</div>

                                        genomics, biology and health. Just imagine the implications of using quantum to
                                        develop a future generation of materials and what that could mean for batteries
                                        or new fertilizers. Just imagine the implications for knowledge and dealing with
                                        complexity with artificial intelligence helping us. I just think it will be

                                        your career, what will be the one thing that you want to be able to say that you
                                        were able to do?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I think that quantum has probably been what I have been
                                        most involved in and I really want to see it through. I think that would be the
                                        one thing, bringing forth quantum computers to the world</div>
                                    <div class="message to">It's a good answer haha. If you could go back and speak to a
                                        younger version of yourself, is there anything you would tell yourself with what
                                        you know now?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I would say to worry less about what others think. I grew
                                        up in a family where my mother is extremely loving but my father - who is a
                                        fantastic person as well - is very authoritarian. So I became very susceptive to
                                        criticism, I was always worried. I am always concerned with what someone thinks
                                        when sometimes I shouldn't. I feel like it is a bit of emotional baggage that I
                                        had</div>
                                    <div class="message to">It's okay we all have some of it</div>
                                    <div class="message from">haha I know but it is just unnecessary. So I would tell
                                        myself just ignore that and really focus on doing a great job with my work and
                                        my teams. I am better at it now but that's what I would tell myself</div>
                                    <div class="message to">If you could recommend one book to somebody what would it
                                        be?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Oh boy. Just 1?</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Haha, well you can rattle off a few if you like</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I would recommend a couple of things. So in the world of
                                        physics and science, I have always loved reading Richard Feynman. His lectures,
                                        the character of physical law, his stories of becoming a scientist and surely
                                        you're joking Mr. Feynman. think his lectures are inspiring, so if you are a
                                        person who is inspired about being a scientist those lectures are wonderful. In
                                        the realm of literature, for short stories I love Jorge Luis Borges. He is a
                                        famous writer from Argentina and arguably one of the world's greatest short
                                        story writers. They are just fantastic stories which still have connection to
                                        the world of mathematics. I love that. To continue on the latin theme, I think
                                        100 years of solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is the best novel written in the
                                        21st century in spanish so I would encourage everyone to read it. It is about
                                        the world of magical realism, it is very beautiful</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Sounds like I have got a few things to look up myself haha.
                                        Dario, thank you so much</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Thank you</div>

                        </section>

                        <p>Here are my key takeaways from the podcast.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Seek Shadowing opportunities</b> - One of the pivotal points in Dario's career and
                                development was shadowing someone in a position that he was looking to move into for a
                                full year. Dario said that this allowed him to really see how the plane was flown, or
                                the ship was steered, or ah, yeh</li>
                            <li> <b>Make your preferences known</b> - Dario stated that once he realised he wanted to go
                                down the managerial track that he let his manger know. It may sound simple but it is
                                extremely important to make your aspirations and preferences known to those around you
                                so that they can help foster your growth</li>
                            <li> <b>Take risks and move into different areas</b> - By constantly taking risks and moving
                                into new areas, Dario was able to transition from being known for being good in a
                                specific area to being known just generally as a great scientist and a great leader.
                                This was one of the key factors which led to him becoming the Director of IBM Research
                            </li>
                            <li> <b>Worry less</b> - I think we can all do this, pretty simple. Focus on doing a great
                                job, building good relationships and enjoying the ride</li>
                            <li> <b>We live in an exciting time</b> - The intersection of quantum, AI, biology will
                                completely transform our lives. Quantum and AI will empower our ability to perform
                                computational genomics and create new materials at a level we have never experienced.
                                This will have huge implications on health, engineering and pretty much just anything
                                imaginable. Our lives are going to be very exciting, which is always a plus</li>
                            <li> <b>Read everything</b> - Dario obviously loves to read. I myself am going to look into the Richard Feynman material before attempting some of his spanish recommendations</li>
                        </ul>
