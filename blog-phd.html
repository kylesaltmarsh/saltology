                    <h1>My Decade of Dissonance: On Finishing a PhD</h1>

                    <p>For the better part of a decade, my PhD was a dark cloud that lingered over me. If I had a spare
                        moment and wasn't working on it, I felt guilty. If I wanted to dive into a new topic that
                        genuinely excited me (like reinforcement learning), or write a blog, I always felt I shouldn't
                        because I should really be doing thesis (but I still did it anyway). For years, it shackled me.
                        Finishing it was one of the most defining
                        moments of my life, not just because a project was complete, but because the journey reshaped
                        me. It took me far too long, but it left me with an immeasurable sense of personal and
                        professional growth. If you read this and all you come away with is a guide of what not to do,
                        then the blog has still done its job. This is my story of becoming Dr. Salty.</p>

                    </section>

                    <p> My journey into research began with a moment of what I would call academic romance. I‚Äôd just
                        finished my undergraduate
                        degree in mechanical engineering, physics, and applied mathematics and had taken a summer
                        internship program with Defence Science and Technology (DST) in their sonar systems team. My
                        project
                        involved measuring the effects of fluid depth on vibrating plates in large water tanks. I picked up a classic textbook, <em>Vibration and Sound</em> by Philip M. Morse <a
                            href="#" class="footnote2-button" data-footnote2-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote2 2"
                            rel="footnote2"
                            data-footnote2-content="<p>A dusty classic from 1936. I still remember my first long grapple with Bessel functions.</p>"><span>2</span></a>,
                        and dived into the world of partial differential equations. Using Mathematica (a crowd
                        favourite amongst the UWA physicists at the time) I managed
                        to apply the book's mathematics to model the plate's resonance frequencies, mode shapes and
                        frequency response
                        functions. I compared my calculations to the experimental data,
                        including laser
                        vibrometry for the mode shapes, and was excited to see the theory and experiment align. This
                        was the moment of academic romance, seeing pure mathematics embodied perfectly in real life was
                        a
                        profound experience <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="Chladni Plate Explanation" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFAcYruShow' target='_blank'>Here</a> is a cool video of a Chladni plate, a flat plate that vibrates to reveal its mathematical mode shapes.</p>"><span>2</span></a>. I decided to continue the research through my honours thesis.</p>

                    <p>After graduating, I did what every other engineering student was doing, desperately applying to
                        about 40 graduate positions and internships.
                        I landed a high-paying internship in the mining
                        industry, working a fly-in-fly-out (FIFO) job for BHP Billiton. I remember feeling relieved.
                        I was going to have a career after all. But over the 3 month internship, the
                        lifestyle and the work began to suck the life out of me. I was fresh out of the university
                        bubble, uncertain about what I wanted to do and what my passions were, but I knew that this was definitely not
                        it. I went to see my Honour's supervisor to discuss the possibility of a PhD, as I‚Äôd been offered a scholarship. I remember being in his office, he echoed my own fears, telling me how
                        he‚Äôd seen the spark leave his students'
                        eyes after years of FIFO work. I decided to turn away from the FIFO job at BHP and applied to do
                        my PhD, continuing my research with DST.</p>

                    <section id="dissonance">
                        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">‚òÅÔ∏è The Dissonance & The Dark Cloud</h1>
                    </section>

                    <p>I entered my PhD with optimism, but I quickly ran into two major problems. Firstly, my industry
                        supervisor at DST, while a brilliant scientist and mentor, had become disheartened with the
                        organisation. Secondly, my main UWA supervisor, did not have as much time for me as I
                        had anticipated. It began to feel as though I was doing a PhD that nobody cared about. The work felt like it lacked purpose.</p>

                    <p>After my first year of candidature, an opportunity for a summer internship came up at Woodside
                        Energy in their artificial intelligence team. Exciting graduate
                        positions in Perth were scarce, so I applied. I got the position and I took 3 months off from my
                        PhD to complete the internship. I was suddenly in an
                        environment where people cared deeply about what I was doing and wanted it done to a high
                        standard, fast. I loved it. I spent the next two summers working there and secured a graduate
                        position. I was then faced with a choice: abandon the hard-won graduate role to finish my PhD
                        full-time, or abandon my PhD. The sunk cost fallacy prevented me from choosing either of those
                        options so I did what any sane person does and thought I will do both at the same time.</p>

                    <p>I started my full time industry career in artificial intelligence and robotics, and was very quickly
                        engulfed by it. Years started to go by with
                        very little progress being made on my thesis, it was always the thing to get put on the back
                        burner

                        <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="3" alt="See Footnote 1"
                            rel="footnote"
                            data-footnote-content="<p>I remember watching Tim Urban's famous <a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Ted Talk</a> on procrastination, and how deeply it resonated with me. Tim talked about the most destructive form of procrastination, procrastination on things that have no strict deadline and how those things just get put off forever. This was exactly what I was doing with my PhD... I then proceeded to watch it several more times in one night rather than writing my thesis.</p>"><span>3</span></a>.
                        In hindsight, it's easy to say it was a mistake to try and do both simultaneously. But at the
                        time, I was focussing my energy where I was experiencing growth. At
                        my new job, I was working with NASA and Boston Dynamics engineers on robotics and learning at
                        the fastest rate of my
                        life. I felt like I was finally unlocking my potential, a feeling that at the time PhD had yet
                        to give to me.
                        I couldn't give
                        that up. So, my PhD was relegated to the background. It became the dark cloud. A source of
                        constant, low-level guilt.
                    </p>

                    <p>I was living a double life, trying to build my new career in robotics while chipping away at a thesis
                        my heart wasn't in. My first big reality check came when I submitted a journal article to the
                        prestigious
                        Journal of Sound and
                        Vibration (JSV). I had published a few conference papers at this point and underestimated the
                        difference in quality and standard at the journal level. Not surprisingly, it was rejected. I
                        remember reading the rejection email and instead of
                        just getting to work and
                        methodically addressing the reviewers' comments, my coping mechanism was pure avoidance. I
                        pushed it from my mind and pretended I never even submitted it. Looking back, this was a clear sign
                        that I was not ready, or deserving. Even in my own heart I did not truly believe I had done
                        anything novel at all. Have you ever heard of imposter syndrome?</p>

                    <p>2022 came around and I submitted yet another draft of my thesis. My supervisor's feedback was
                        that it needed
                        a significant expansion of the analytical modelling. I did not want to hear it at the time, but
                        he was right. My early thesis drafts, as well as the journal article that was
                        rejected by JSV, were simply not up to the standard of a PhD or a Tier 1 journal. It started
                        becoming painfully clear that
                        to get this done, I needed to make a much more significant investment of time than I had hoped.
                        Wishing to stay in industry, I felt that I did not need the publications and just focussed my
                        effort on the thesis so I could just graduate. So for the next year I
                        worked hard at the mathematical modelling, and had gotten results that aligned well with my
                        experimental and numerical simulations. I redid my entire thesis, confident I now had all the
                        core components in place. However by this point,
                        I believe my supervisor had lost faith in me. I was the boy who cried wolf (or completed
                        thesis?). He barely reviewed my work, and even
                        suggested I downgrade my PhD to a Masters by research. Whilst I could not blame him for losing
                        faith in me, I truly felt that I had significantly enhanced my work now and that all the components of a PhD
                        thesis were there. I felt I had done enough, but he did not see it that way. The impasse with him
                        left me feeling like there was no way forward.</p>

                    <section id="reset">
                        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">üîÅ The Reset & The Rediscovery</h1>
                    </section>

                    <p>At a loss, I reached out to the graduate research coordinator for advice.
                        He was incredibly helpful, but one piece of advice stood out.</p>

                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>"Go get external review on your work by submitting it to journals." </b></em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I went to dinner with a close friend who had finished their PhD,
                        Thiru, who had recently agreed to give me a full, in-depth
                        critical review of my entire thesis. At dinner I asked him what he thought, if he thought I had
                        done enough to finally earn my PhD. Thiru has an affinity for maths (and cigars), and I was
                        expecting him to start the critique by
                        dissecting the mathematical approach I had taken in my modelling, perhaps between clouds of cigar smoke.
                        But instead he looked me dead in the eye and said:</p>

                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>"Kyle, you have done some great work...but when I read your thesis, it reads as
                                    though its been written by a man who fell out of love with his work many years ago.
                                    I know it will be hard after all these years, but you have to reset and rediscover
                                    the romance of your work. You are working on such a beautiful and fundamental problem.
                                    You need to rediscover what it was that drew you to it in the first
                                    place. I suggest that you take some time off, and come back to it when you have
                                    refound that romance." </b></em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>He was 100% right. I had not been working as a scientist who was charmed and enthralled in their
                        work, I had
                        been working as a man who just wanted to cross the finish line. How could I convince my
                        supervisor (or anyone else) that what I was doing was valuable, if I
                        didn't even believe it myself? Thiru was right, it was a beautiful problem, solving and working
                        on the fundamental mathematical constructs that explain the world around us. I took a week off
                        to reflect, before starting to work 40 hours a week on my thesis, driven by a new-found
                        purpose. I did 90 minutes every morning before work, 90 minutes in the evening, and the entire
                        weekend, for many many months. Thiru even sent me 6 hours of voice memos, detailing his gripes and advice for my work and thesis, which I grew to enjoy listening to at 530AM every morning. It was the most disciplined and driven I had ever been in my life. I was locked in.
                    </p>

                    <p>I learnt how to write like a scientist, how every sentence in my academic writing
                    should be either a claim, evidence or a warrant <a href="#" class="footnote2-button"
                        data-footnote2-identifier="3" alt="See Footnote2 2" rel="footnote2"
                        data-footnote2-content="<p><strong>Claim:</strong> The claim is the main argument or debatable assertion you are putting forward. <strong>Evidence:</strong> Evidence is the factual information, data, examples, or cited sources you use to support and prove your claim. <strong>Warrant:</strong> The warrant is the logical explanation that connects your evidence to your claim, showing why that data is relevant.</p>"><span>3</span></a>.
                    Following the graduate research coordinator's advice, I began to use the
                    results from my thesis to prepare two full-length articles. I learnt the differences in
                    authorial voice and tone between writing a thesis and writing journal articles. I then
                    identified the journal for submission, <a
                            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-acoustics"
                            target="_blank">Applied Acoustics</a>, the #2 ranked journal in my field. I noticed one of the editors was Australian, so I found her number and gave her a call, asking
                    for just two minutes of her time. She then proceeded to speak with me for 40 minutes, giving me invaluable
                    advice not just on the submission process, but also on getting to the finish line for my PhD. Her generous gesture had a well timed
                    impact on me, and imbued the confidence that had slowly been building within me.</p>

                    <p>I decided to navigate the entire submission process independently from my supervisors. I knew
                        that this is not how it is suppose to be done, but I felt that at this point they had lost faith
                        in me over the years and with that, their willingness to support me had dwindled. I needed to prove to them
                        that I was serious. The <a
                            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X24003013"
                            target="_blank">first journal article</a> was accepted with minor
                        revisions. Reading this was the most rewarding and powerful moment for me over my entire
                        candidature. After years of doubt and imposter syndrome, this gave me confidence and
                        validation that the work I had done was indeed valuable and novel. You always remember your first huh? My <a
                            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X24004572"
                            target="_blank">second journal article</a> was not quite as smooth sailing as the first. The
                        first reviewer recommended acceptance with minor revisions which was great, but the second reviewer rejected it,
                        saying I needed to resubmit with substantially more novel work, claiming it was too similar to my first
                        paper. This time, I had the confidence and the resilience to face this. I strongly disagreed
                        with the reviewer about the similarity of the articles, but his review made me realise that I could have done a much better job of explaining
                        the differences between the two articles. I had learnt to write like an academic, but navigating this rejection through
                        the journal review process I now needed to learn to write like a lawyer.</p>
                        
                        <p>I carefully constructed my <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1XTlNv8PbESLJW6aWxN02U9RFFNh2bF6f" target="_blank" download="Saltmarsh-Reviewer-Response.pdf">response to the reviewer</a>. I learnt how to write a respectful, but systematic rebuttal that
                        dismantled the critique using direct comparisons and itemised evidence to prove my article's
                        novel contribution beyond any doubt.
                        The reviewer responded with a simple sentence.</p>

                                            <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em><b>"In this new version, it seems that the author has
                        now tried his best to improve the overall quality of manuscript." </b></em></p>
                    </div>
                        
                        <p> I reacted to their slightly
                        condescending and reluctant acceptance with a smile. I now had the core elements of my thesis peer reviewed and published. The last and final hurdle was to finally get my supervisor's blessing to
                        have the thesis sent out for examination.</p>

                        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">ü§ù The Breakthrough</h1>
                    </section>

                    <p>Expecting the worst, I was gearing up for a battle, preparing and already resigned to the fact that I would probably have to submit my thesis
                        independently, which was it's own particular can of worms. Then, one day I was at an away day on the UWA campus for my industry job and I thought:</p>

                    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                        <p><em> <b>"Why not just go see him?"</b> </em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I walked through the engineering building, reliving all the memories of my time there and noticing how nothing seemed to have changed. I walked past rooms with tutors teaching classes of students, and laughed to myself about
                        the time the graduate research school had phoned me inquiring as to why I had done 120 hours of tutorial work in a single fortnight when the limit for a PhD student was 16 hours. This was yet another contributing factor to why it took me almost a decade to finish.
                        I knocked on his door and entered his office. Surprised to see me, he asked how I was. I just opened up. </p>
                        
                        <p>I told him the story of Thiru
                        urging me to find the love for my work again, and how that I
                        finally had. I told him about my two freshly published
                        journal articles. I told him about the immense effort I'd put in and told him how badly I wanted this. To my complete surprise, his demeanor changed. He told me he could see the focus
                        and the work I‚Äôd put in. He was impressed that I had successfully navigated the
                        entire peer-review process on my own. He said, "This Thiru sounds like a very good friend." The feeling became even more surprising as he turned from the gatekeeper between me and my
                        freedom, into the driving force pushing me over the finish line. Within two weeks, he
                        had provided detailed feedback on my thesis, contacted and secured the identified examiners, and submitted the thesis for external review. It was
                        surreal. Given the work had already been published, the external examiners passed the thesis
                        with only minor revisions. After years of struggle,
                        the final hurdle felt surprisingly easy. It was a mere formality.</p>

                        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">üå§Ô∏è Epilogue</h1>
                    </section>

                     <p>Years ago, Thiru had gifted me a book, "The
                        Structure of Scientific Revolutions." <a href="#" class="footnote2-button"
                            data-footnote2-identifier="4" alt="See Footnote2 1" rel="footnote2"
                            data-footnote2-content="<p>Written by Thomas S. Kuhn in 1962, it's a landmark book in the history and philosophy of science. It argues that science doesn't progress in a linear, continuous way, but undergoes periodic 'paradigm shifts'. Reading it after my journey felt like I finally understood what it meant to participate in that process, even in a small way.</p>"><span>4</span></a>
                        I tried reading it back then and couldn't get past page 10. In the midst of my final push, I
                        picked it up again and finished it in a week. For the first time, I felt like I resonated with
                        the identity of a "scientist". Perhaps Thiru knew (even when I didn't) that I would always get there...even if it was eventually.</p>

                    <p>Looking back, my frustration with my supervisor has now been replaced by gratitude. He never
                        gifted me anything. He held a standard he knew I could‚Äîand should‚Äîreach. If he had let me pass
                        with my earlier, subpar work, I would not have gone through the immense growth that I did. I
                        wouldn't have learned resilience, rediscovered my passion, or earned the confidence I now have and will carry with me for the rest of my life.</p>

                        <p>The dark cloud has finally lifted. As I look forward, I feel a profound sense of freedom and
                        excitement for the next chapter. The journey was long and arduous, but the discipline, skills,
                        and maturity I gained are invaluable. I am, at last, ready for what's next. <a href="#"

                    </section>

                    <p>Here are my key takeaways.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>You Must Be Your Own Biggest Advocate</b> - No one will ever care about your work as
                            much as you do. You have to be the primary driving force. If you lose the passion, you have
                            to be the one to find a way to reignite it.</li>
                        <li><b>Seek external feedback and mentorship.</b> When I wasn't getting feedback internally,
                            seeking it from colleagues, other academics, and the journal review process was crucial. It
                            provided both critical guidance and the validation I needed to keep going.</li>
                        <li> <b>Build Your Network (and Don't Be Afraid to Use It)</b> - A simple phone call with a
                            kind editor changed the trajectory of my submissions. A heartfelt conversation with a friend
                            changed my entire mindset. Build genuine connections, and don't be afraid to ask for help.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>Resilience is a Muscle</b> - My first rejection crushed me. My later ones empowered me.
                            The only way to build resilience to failure and criticism is by facing it, again and again.
                            You learn that it's not a verdict on your worth, but a roadmap for improvement.</li>
                        <li> <b>Embrace the Personal Connection</b> - After years of formal, stalled communication, a
                            single, honest, face-to-face conversation resolved everything. Never underestimate the power
                            of dropping the guard and connecting on a human level.</li>
                        <li> <b>Imposter Syndrome is Real, But It's Not Reality</b> - For years, I doubted if I was a
                            "real scientist." It was only after publishing, after earning the validation of my work through the journal review process,
                            that the feeling began to fade. It's a feeling, not a fact. Let your work speak for itself.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>Find the Romance in Your Work</b> - This might be the most important lesson. You can't
                            sustain a decade of effort on pure discipline. You have to find that spark, that genuine
                            curiosity and love for the subject, that makes the struggle worthwhile.</li>
                    </ul>
