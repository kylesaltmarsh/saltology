                        <p>During THINK 2019 I had good success in reaching out to people. Perhaps I might have got overzealous as I decided to try my luck at asking IBM CEO Ginni Rometty for an interview, because you know, you never know unless you try right? She replied (which was big enough news already) stating that she admired my tenacity but unfortunately she was booked end to end, to which I thought - Fair enough. She then however introduced me over email to Mark Foster, Senior Vice President of Global Business Services at IBM, suggesting that he might be interested in accepting such a request. Awesome. I arranged a time to meet with Mark and then quickly set out to learn as much as I could before the interview. One of the first things I realised when I found Mark's blog is that he has led an extremely full and balanced life. His blogs had strong notes of family, friends, hobbies and helping others. Meeting Mark was an absolute pleasure. As someone that is personally driven to both have a succesful rewarding career as well as a balance lifestyle, I found Mark particularly inspiring. From an ancient history graduate to global leader in one of the world's greatest technology companies, Mark's story is a great example that your university degree doesn't have to determine the career path you take. Mark is a super nice guy and I believe that IBM GBS is in great hands. Hope you guys enjoy the interview!</p>

I am a very keen 7-a-side soccer player but I am also very bad at playing 7-a-side soccer, so I play with a bunch of dads back in my sons school whenever I can<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p> <b>Speech-To-Text Blooper</b> <br> So I'm belaying seven inside soccer player.

                                            <div class="message from">Yes exactly so we need 7 otherwise we get exhausted too quickly.

No seriously I had some inspirational teachers, like many people it all comes down to having someone that inspires you to do something and I was lucky enough to have a couple of really inspirational people - who by the way I am still in contact with even though both of them are into their 80s and 90s - who absolutely inspired me to love those languages, love that history and really engage</div>
                                            <div class="message to">You really do develop that deep connection with someone who that has mentored you through something, it lasts forever. I understand that your first role after that was at Accenture, would you be able to briefly go through your career there?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Well it is very hard to briefly go through 27 years<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier=“4” alt="See Footnote 4” rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>The troubles of only having 15 minutes to pick Mark’s brain about everything I possibly could</p>"><span>4</span></a></div>
                                            <div class="message to">Yes I know, 27 years does makes it hard haha</div>
                                            <div class="message from">But the key thing there was that was I was lucky enough to be in the organisation and it start off as Arthur Anderson Consulting, became Anderson consulting and then became Accenture and over those 27 years I was part of the building of a really amazing organisation that went from a relatively small to being to several hundred thousands of people. Being involved with that as a leader over that whole transformation was a unique privilege, I learnt a ton and I had various roles culminating in running all of the retail, consumer health and life sciences and industrial space for 5 years and then finally running all of managing consulting globally. So, fantastic ride, learnt a lot and still have lots of friends over there</div>
                                            <div class="message to">Mmm I’m sure you would over that span of time. Then you took quite a change in career after that, you joined the UK government?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Well I actually retired in 2011. So I retired in 2011 on the basis that I was tired out after 27 years and also I just wanted to do something different and so I joined a few boards</div>
                                            <div class="message to">It was 6 wasnt it?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">4 boards, but I was also appointed one of the three people to oversee the UK's aid budget which is 12 billion a year they spend on aid. They had just in fact protected that budget at the time of austerity and everything else was being spent so they wanted an independent watchdog to make sure the government was spending the money wisely. So I spent the next four years travelling to all of the far flung places of the world like Somalia, across Africa, across Asia, sitting under trees in villages and clinics in people's huts and houses talking to them about whether or not the things we we're trying to do for them will make a difference to their lives</div>
                                            <div class="message to">That must have been very rewarding I imagine</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Very rewarding, hugely humbling and just learned a ton about the world of course through that. Then also had the experience of then coming back and talking about it in Parliament and actually explaining to the taxpayer whether or not it was all working or not</div>
                                            <div class="message to">That would give you such a different lens on on life I suppose going through that experience</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Well I think both that and the starting point of my background and looking at the long view of history, I think those two things give me slightly more perspective than perhaps the narrow day to day thinking around either a particular technology or a particular project or a particular moment in time or a quarter. You have to think over the slightly longer term to make change happen and understand what people are going through and I think that perspective I find is something I draw upon all the time</div>                       
                                            <div class="message to">That's awesome, and then how did you come to join IBM?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Surprisingly I think</div>
                                            <div class="message to">Surprisingly haha, just sort of fell into it?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">I mean after 5 1/2 years of doing pretty much anything else apart from full time working it wasn't part of my plan to plunge back into it, but to be honest with you, the call came through and I had a set of very exciting interesting conversations with Ginni and within a month I'd turned my life upside down. I'd stepped off all these boards, moved my wife and I over to the US and had taken on running a 130 thousand person, 17 billion dollar, thing</div>

I've had to plunge back into all these new technologies, whether it is AI, quantum or block Chain - the whole world and this change that is out there. I thought it would be exciting but it's actually outliving living those expectations</div>  
                                            <div class="message to">That's awesome. Well it's a it's a very good time to come back</div>
                                            <div class="message from">I think this is a really important inflection point. And I've spent my time here at THINK really talking about - this one of those moments in time when technology kind of comes together, It converges at scale and makes a really big difference as to whether or not you're going to be able to transform your business. This whole idea of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/cognitive-enterprise" target=&quot;_blank&quot>Cognitive Enterprise</a> we've created is really our thought leadership around what that means for our clients</div>                                                 
                                            <div class="message to">It’s funny, everyone I have interviewed everyone also believes that we really are on that elbow of exponential growth in technology right now, that's where we have really entered and it's really about to take off. It's exciting. What would you say the most rewarding part about your current role is now?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Quite simply it's meeting people. I mean this is a fantastic opportunity to work with the 130 thousand people in GBS, but now also the 120 thousand in GTS, but more importantly it’s the huge breadth of talent across an organisation like IBM. In the end the thing that always excites me about all the leadership roles I've been fortunate to have over my life has been I just like being around groups of people, trying to inspire them, trying to learn from them and that was something that I was actually missing in my in my 5 1/2 years of being retired and so I'm glad to be kind of back in the middle of that</div>
                                            <div class="message to">That's awesome and that's one of the reasons I've reached out to you as well, to help inspire some of the younger community back in Australia New Zealand. When you look back on your career I suppose, when once you retire for maybe the second or perhaps the third I'm not sure what you have planned, but when it's done and you're looking back on your career, what would be the one thing you would like to look back on and say that you did?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">I would like to think that I - again like like I talked about being inspired by those teachers who taught me and set me on this path - I'd like to think that I can look back and that there are people that I have managed to touch who feel simply inspired and have gone on to have careers that I hope will surpass mine. I mean that's really the most important thing. I will say also there are other things in life, of course my work is important and those jobs have been big but actually of course I'm hugely proud of my family and my kids and my wife<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="5" alt="See Footnote 5" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p><b>Speech-To-Text Blooper</b> <br>Those jobs have been have been big but actually of course I'm young.

It seems that outside of work you've really had a full balanced life you know with friends and family, with your sports, history, photography, you travel, you have all of these other aspects of your life, these other pillars of your life that that you draw happiness from. How do you go about, throughout your career, balancing all of those? What did you find works specifically for you?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">No I think it's it's a great point and first of all it is important to have these other things, I believe all of us need to have a broad broad range of things that are interesting us, keep that balance in what we're doing. If we all become narrow it really is really is bad for us and it's bad for the people around us. You do need to compartmentalise it. You also need to plan it. It is not something that happens just by happenstance. One of the things that that actually came out for me having written a monthly blog, pretty much for every month since about 2002</div>                      
                                            <div class="message to">Wow, how many blog posts do you have on there?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Well actually the ones that are actually out publicly are only the ones that happened while I was retired, I had an internal blog over my time with Accenture and now I have an internal blog now here. So I sadly can look back and work out what I was doing every month over that long period of time, but more importantly, because I'm going to do it it makes me think about what the next month is going to be  and if it will be interesting enough to have something to write about. That talks to a little bit about making sure that you are planning at least at least a balance of things and I think that's something we can all do. Sometimes of course the work swings to being a bit more than that but I think it's actually much more in your own hands than you realise. A lot of it is about making some choices, being deliberate and planful and I think if you do that then there's a decent chance of things working out</div>                      
                                            <div class="message to">If you could go back and perhaps speak to a younger version of yourself what would be the advice that you would give to yourself?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">I think  keep on trying. Keep on pushing on. I mean I think that the key thing about all this stuff is that first of all, the one thing you can’t be planful about is actually where your career and work is going to go. I had no expectation I'd be doing this right now, at all, even a couple of years ago. I had no expectation at any point in my time at Accenture that I was gonna have the next job I was gonna get through that time. All I was focused on was trying to enjoy what I was doing at that moment in time, try and do a good job and try and slightly push the boundaries if I could, to either see an adjacent area, something else that might interest me and I think that keeping up that curiosity, keeping up that sense of - do a good job but also think about what’s next, exploring something new but adjacent - I think that has what stood me in good stead and it's something even now I still draw on all time</div>                        
                                            <div class="message to">That's really good advice. If you could recommend one book to somebody, and it can't be your blog or your series of blogs, what would be the book that you would recommend?</div>
                                            <div class="message from">I'd recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Nearly-Everything-ebook/dp/B000FBFNII" target=&quot;_blank&quot> <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i></a> by Bill Bryson. It's a great book that makes us all realise how we sit in the in the universe. At one level how insignificant we are but also at one level how amazing we are</div>                        
                                            <div class="message to">That feeling when you when you go through those exercises of sort of putting everything's subjective can be very humbling</div>
                                            <div class="message from">Yes, exactly</div>
                                            <div class="message to">Mark, thank you so much for your time</div>

                        </section>

                        <p>Here are my key takeaways from the podcast.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Your degree doesn't have define your career</b> - As a graduate in ancient Greek and Latin language and history, Mark is now a global leader at IBM, one of the largest and greatest tehcnology companies in the world </li>
                            <li> <b>Live a balanced life</b> - Mark sresses that we need to have a wide range of things in our life that interest us and that when we become narrow, it is not good for us or those arounds us</li>
                            <li> <b>Be planful</b> - Mark uses his monthly blog as a way of thinking about what he has planned for next month and if it will be interesting enough to write about. This helps him make sure he plans for a variety of activities in his life</li>
                            <li> <b>Inspire others</b> - When Mark looks back on his career, he wishes he will be able to say that he has inspired those people around him, much like others had inspired him during his life journey</li>
                            <li> <b>Keep on trying</b> - If Mark could talk to a younger version of himself he would say just keep on trying. The only thing you can't be planful of is where your career will take you, so just focus on enjoying what you are doing at the time, do a good job and always look for adjacent areas to explore and maintain that curiosity</li>
                            <li> <b>Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Nearly-Everything-ebook/dp/B000FBFNII" target=&quot;_blank&quot> <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i></a> by Bill Bryson</b> - It's a great book that makes us all realise how we sit in the in the universe. At one level how insignificant we are but also at one level how amazing we are</li>
                        </ul>
