                    <h1>Mark Foster &mdash; SVP Global Business Services at IBM</h1>

                    <p>During THINK 2019 I had good success in reaching out to people. Perhaps I might have got
                        overzealous as I decided to try my luck at asking IBM CEO Ginni Rometty for an interview,
                        because you know, you never know unless you try right? She replied (which was big enough news
                        already) stating that she admired my tenacity but unfortunately she was booked end to end, to
                        which I thought - fair enough. She then however introduced me over email to Mark Foster, Senior
                        Vice President of Global Business Services at IBM, suggesting that he might be interested in
                        accepting such a request. Awesome. I arranged a time to meet with Mark and then quickly set out
                        to learn as much as I could before the interview. One of the first things I realised when I
                        found Mark's blog is that he has led an extremely full and balanced life. His blogs had strong
                        notes of family, friends, hobbies and helping others. Meeting Mark was an absolute pleasure. As
                        someone that is personally driven to both have a successful rewarding career as well as a balance
                        lifestyle, I found Mark particularly inspiring. From an ancient history graduate to global
                        leader in one of the world's greatest technology companies, Mark's story is a great example that
                        your university degree doesn't have to determine the career path you take. Mark is a super nice
                        guy and I believe that IBM GBS is in great hands. Hope you guys enjoy the interview!</p>

                                    in the organisation and it start off as Arthur Anderson Consulting, became Anderson
                                    consulting and then became Accenture and over those 27 years I was part of the
                                    building of a really amazing organisation that went from a relatively small to being
                                    to several hundred thousands of people. Being involved with that as a leader over
                                    that whole transformation was a unique privilege, I learnt a ton and I had various
                                    roles culminating in running all of the retail, consumer health and life sciences
                                    and industrial space for 5 years and then finally running all of managing consulting
                                    globally. So, fantastic ride, learnt a lot and still have lots of friends over there

                                <div class="message from">Well I actually retired in 2011. So I retired in 2011 on the
                                    basis that I was tired out after 27 years and also I just wanted to do something
                                    different and so I joined a few boards</div>
                                <div class="message to">It was 6 wasnt it?</div>
                                <div class="message from">4 boards, but I was also appointed one of the three people to
                                    oversee the UK's aid budget which is 12 billion a year they spend on aid. They had
                                    just in fact protected that budget at the time of austerity and everything else was
                                    being spent so they wanted an independent watchdog to make sure the government was
                                    spending the money wisely. So I spent the next four years travelling to all of the
                                    far flung places of the world like Somalia, across Africa, across Asia, sitting
                                    under trees in villages and clinics in people's huts and houses talking to them
                                    about whether or not the things we we're trying to do for them will make a

                                    and talking about it in Parliament and actually explaining to the taxpayer whether
                                    or not it was all working or not</div>

                                    more perspective than perhaps the narrow day to day thinking around either a

                                    quarter. You have to think over the slightly longer term to make change happen and
                                    understand what people are going through and I think that perspective I find is
                                    something I draw upon all the time</div>

                                    to be honest with you, the call came through and I had a set of very exciting
                                    interesting conversations with Ginni and within a month I'd turned my life upside

                                    world and this change that is out there. I thought it would be exciting but it's

                                    organisation like IBM. In the end the thing that always excites me about all the
                                    leadership roles I've been fortunate to have over my life has been I just like being
                                    around groups of people, trying to inspire them, trying to learn from them and that

                                    done and you're looking back on your career, what would be the one thing you would

                                    think that I can look back and that there are people that I have managed to touch
                                    who feel simply inspired and have gone on to have careers that I hope will surpass
                                    mine. I mean that's really the most important thing. I will say also there are other
                                    things in life, of course my work is important and those jobs have been big but

                                <div class="message to">Yeah well that segways perfectly, its like you knew my next
                                    question, I did look at your blog before coming and I see that you're quite an avid
                                    blogger. It seems that outside of work you've really had a full balanced life you
                                    know with friends and family, with your sports, history, photography, you travel,
                                    you have all of these other aspects of your life, these other pillars of your life
                                    that that you draw happiness from. How do you go about, throughout your career,
                                    balancing all of those? What did you find works specifically for you?</div>
                                <div class="message from">No I think it's it's a great point and first of all it is
                                    important to have these other things, I believe all of us need to have a broad broad
                                    range of things that are interesting us, keep that balance in what we're doing. If
                                    we all become narrow it really is really is bad for us and it's bad for the people
                                    around us. You do need to compartmentalise it. You also need to plan it. It is not
                                    something that happens just by happenstance. One of the things that that actually
                                    came out for me having written a monthly blog, pretty much for every month since
                                    about 2002</div>
                                <div class="message to">Wow, how many blog posts do you have on there?</div>
                                <div class="message from">Well actually the ones that are actually out publicly are only
                                    the ones that happened while I was retired, I had an internal blog over my time with
                                    Accenture and now I have an internal blog now here. So I sadly can look back and
                                    work out what I was doing every month over that long period of time, but more
                                    importantly, because I'm going to do it it makes me think about what the next month
                                    is going to be and if it will be interesting enough to have something to write
                                    about. That talks to a little bit about making sure that you are planning at least
                                    at least a balance of things and I think that's something we can all do. Sometimes
                                    of course the work swings to being a bit more than that but I think it's actually
                                    much more in your own hands than you realise. A lot of it is about making some
                                    choices, being deliberate and planful and I think if you do that then there's a
                                    decent chance of things working out</div>
                                <div class="message to">If you could go back and perhaps speak to a younger version of
                                    yourself what would be the advice that you would give to yourself?</div>
                                <div class="message from">I think keep on trying. Keep on pushing on. I mean I think
                                    that the key thing about all this stuff is that first of all, the one thing you
                                    can’t be planful about is actually where your career and work is going to go. I had
                                    no expectation I'd be doing this right now, at all, even a couple of years ago. I
                                    had no expectation at any point in my time at Accenture that I was gonna have the
                                    next job I was gonna get through that time. All I was focused on was trying to enjoy
                                    what I was doing at that moment in time, try and do a good job and try and slightly
                                    push the boundaries if I could, to either see an adjacent area, something else that
                                    might interest me and I think that keeping up that curiosity, keeping up that sense
                                    of - do a good job but also think about what’s next, exploring something new but
                                    adjacent - I think that has what stood me in good stead and it's something even now
                                    I still draw on all time</div>

                        <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">💡 Key Messages</h1>
                    </section>

                    <p>Here are my key takeaways from the podcast.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Your degree doesn't have define your career</b> - As a graduate in ancient Greek and
                            Latin language and history, Mark is now a global leader at IBM, one of the largest and
                            greatest technology companies in the world </li>
                        <li> <b>Live a balanced life</b> - Mark stresses that we need to have a wide range of things in
                            our life that interest us and that when we become narrow, it is not good for us or those
                            arounds us</li>
                        <li> <b>Be planful</b> - Mark uses his monthly blog as a way of thinking about what he has
                            planned for next month and if it will be interesting enough to write about. This helps him
                            make sure he plans for a variety of activities in his life</li>
                        <li> <b>Inspire others</b> - When Mark looks back on his career, he wishes he will be able to
                            say that he has inspired those people around him, much like others had inspired him during
                            his life journey</li>
                        <li> <b>Keep on trying</b> - If Mark could talk to a younger version of himself he would say
                            just keep on trying. The only thing you can't be planful of is where your career will take
                            you, so just focus on enjoying what you are doing at the time, do a good job and always look
                            for adjacent areas to explore and maintain that curiosity</li>
                        <li> <b>Read <a
                                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Nearly-Everything-ebook/dp/B000FBFNII"
