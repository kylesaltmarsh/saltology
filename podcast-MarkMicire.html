                        <h1>Dr. Mark Micire &mdash; Head of Robotics, Woodside Energy</h1>

                        <p>
                            When I first heard the name Mark Micire it was in an announcement that he would be my next
                            boss. When I first <i>saw</i> Mark Micire it was when I googled him and this intimidating <a
                                href="MarkMicireScary.html" target=&quot;_blank&quot> photo</a> came up. My immediate
                            thought was <i>"Oh no... we're getting a corporate American hard-ass"</i>. When Mark took
                            over
                            the team I quickly realised that he is one of the most easy going, down to earth, straight
                            down the line guys I have ever met. Mark's resume speaks for itself, but that wouldn't make
                            for a good podcast so we will be exploring his career life journey to date. It was a great
                            pleasure to interview
                            Mark and has been a long time coming. Enjoy the podcast.

                            than the real content itself. These footnotes are slightly more boring <a href="#"

                                        So today I have the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Mark Micire, ex CEO for a
                                        search and rescue, robotic startup, ex Program Manager at DAPA, ex Robotics
                                        Group Lead at NASA Ames and Technical Search Specialist at FEMA, the Federal
                                        Emergency
                                        Management Agency and now head of robotics at Woodside Energy. Or, as we like to
                                        call you - just mark. So I thought I'd kick us off with a bit of an icebreaker.
                                        I might be able to guess some of these, but I thought if you could tell us your
                                        favorite food, your favorite hobby and your favorite movie</div>
                                    <div class="message from">All right, let's see. Favorite food, probably hamburger,
                                        cheeseburger specifically. As basic as that is it is definitely a go to for me.
                                        Favorite hobby, pretty hardcore into just computer nerding and geekery and stuff
                                        like that. Close Second would be automobiles, spent some time owning and driving
                                        some really fast cars, so that's that would be my other one</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So I'm zero for three right now</div>
                                    <div class="message from">What was the last one?</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And your favorite movie</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Oh wargames. Yeah, the movie set the course that was the
                                        trajectories setting movie of my life, not that I almost started a nuclear war,
                                        the computer part for sure
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">Hahaha yeah okay, so zero for three, I had you as a burrito,
                                        photography, and I took a wild guess that Space Odyssey X for the movie. So
                                        you've had a very interesting career as per my introduction now I probably know
                                        a lot about you already, but theres still probably a lot I don't know, but I
                                        thought we could take a bit of a trip down memory lane. Would you be able to
                                        tell us about the study you did straight after high school and what sort of led
                                        you to choose that study that you did</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So out of high school I was very, very much into what we
                                        now call cyber. We didn't really call it cyber back then. It was... Security was
                                        the thing that the I.T. guys did when they weren't fixing servers. Like it
                                        wasn't really a career path, it's just this thing that sometimes you think you
                                        did. And to put it in time and it make me feel old, this is you're talking mid
                                        to late 90s. So cybersecurity was not a career path, but it was absolutely where
                                        I found joy was breaking things, specifically breaking computers and figuring
                                        out the way that things would fail and then finding ways to do interesting
                                        things with those failures. So when I went to university, through all of my
                                        undergraduate although I was in a school of engineering, I was in computer
                                        science and a lot of their stuff focused on a lot of the computer science core
                                        curriculum, but they actually had a bit of an I.T. bent to what they were doing.
                                        And I was also working full time job, I'll say on the side, it was more or less
                                        I was doing university and had a full time job doing I.T. stuff, and then I
                                        basically burned out on it. They say that the best way to ruin a hobby is to
                                        make it your job. And so by the time I hit my senior year at university, I
                                        didn't want to do anything related to security, computer science, anything like
                                        that. Computer science, maybe, but definitely I had the opportunity I needed,
                                        one elective course in my senior year and there was this robotics course, and I
                                        grew up playing with radio controlled cars and other things like that. And I
                                        think I naively thought to myself well robots are nothing but radio controlled
                                        cars with computers on them</div>
                                    <div class="message to">That's what I was thinking</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So right, so this should be easy like I should be able to
                                        go in and long story short, I ended up taking the robotics class, fell in love
                                        with it and completely abandoned the cyber security stuff with the promise to
                                        myself that I would go back three or four years later and see if that had
                                        healed. And so, you know, fast forward to today, that's pretty much while
                                        robotics is my day job on any given Saturday i'm just diving into and totally
                                        geeking out on doing cybersecurity and other type, computer science-y stuff
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">and you've given talks and stuff on operational security,
                                        and OT. So I found your dissertation title</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I'm sorry</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Hahah and for your master's study, and it's probably one of
                                        the more interesting sounding ones I've heard of, definitely much more
                                        interesting than than mine. So "the analysis of robot assisted search and rescue
                                        response to the World Trade Center disaster". Straight after that you then went
                                        into robotic startup for five years, would you be able to talk about what you
                                        did for your masters and how that sort of led to the robotics startup?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, so for the Masters, so I got very fortunate in that
                                        when the trade center disaster happened, the lab that I happened to be working
                                        in. So that's actually a good Segway. So took that robotics course, started
                                        working in the lab that for the professor that was teaching that elective course
                                        and basically ended up being kind of the lab manager there. So I was fixing all
                                        the robots as a master student, keeping all the stuff running for the the Ph.D.
                                        students and then part of the focus of the research of the lab was in search and
                                        rescue, and we really didn't know what we were doing at that point in the game.
                                        But there was some interest from the local fire department and we thought it was
                                        a domain that we might be able to play into just because putting robots in some
                                        of these like crazy hazardous situations just makes sense. And so myself and
                                        another grad student had started working with the local fire department and
                                        started getting some getting some certifications. So we had done like we've done
                                        trench rescue and a little bit hazmat and other things like that. And then
                                        September 11th happens. Our DARPA program manager, who is funding most of the
                                        work that we did in our lab, called us up and basically said, Look, all of the
                                        equipment you have, and if you've got any personnel that can support that
                                        equipment, I need you to load it up and get to New York. Like This is an all
                                        call. Wow. And so we were one of probably a half dozen different groups that
                                        were there. Now, strangely enough. And it was almost, I don't know. I'd say it's
                                        by accident, but we certainly didn't plan for this when it came time to actually
                                        go and deploy these robots. I was pretty much myself and my other student
                                        colleague and then a couple of other folks that were with one of the other teams
                                        that had any training whatsoever, even in safety as to how to operate on these
                                        kind of sites and stuff like that. And so very quickly, we kind of got pulled
                                        forward. And then the gift that I then had but didn't realize it at the time was
                                        I got to spend effectively the next .. well we were there for a total of 11
                                        days. And during those 11 days, I was one of the operators of the equipment that
                                        we used on the pile <a href="#" class="footnote-button"
                                            data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote"
                                            data-footnote-content="<p>  <a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/upbEK71eixM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>This</a>  is a video of Mark using the search and rescue robot to investigate a damaged apartment after Hurricane Katrina. </p>"><span>2</span></a>.
                                        So that then became the thesis. So the theme for that
                                        thesis is we broke everything that we took up there. There wasn't a single piece
                                        of equipment that didn't ended up busted in some way. Yeah, each one of those
                                        breakages shows either a lack of engineering or imagination or just the
                                        equipment wasn't prepared for what we were putting it in</div>
                                    <div class="message to">You didn't know what you're expected to use on potentially
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly and we were borrowing from other industries. So
                                        like the equipment, the most useful piece of equipment that we had at the trade
                                        center was actually a robot that was designed for pipe crawling and was designed
                                        for like industrial inspection applications that then we're now throwing into a
                                        rubble pile with dirt and mud and bodily fluids and other things. And so simple
                                        things like How do you decontaminate this robot wasn't something that was in the
                                        original spec, especially when you're dealing with biologics and other things
                                        like that. And so, yeah, I had that experience, and then the master's thesis
                                        became an analysis of all of the things that we broke with the idea that that
                                        would become these are all things that we would need to improve upon if you were
                                        to ever succeed in this fire rescue domain. Got done with my thesis and then
                                        realized it was actually a business opportunity there</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And so that led to the startup</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So graduated, was able to was fortunate to have a couple
                                        of really wonderful angel investors that were very supportive of me wanting to
                                        go forward and do this. They helped to bootstrap the company. We spent about a
                                        year and a half developing the product that was we actually did that as a
                                        partnership with the company that built the equipment that we used in New York
                                        in terms of manufacturing capabilities and other things like that. They just
                                        helped speed up everything that we were doing because they were already building
                                        equipment and had tooling and everything else. And then about two, I guess it
                                        was about two years later we had a piece of equipment that was ready to sell and
                                        we immediately sold about, I think, our first units out the door, there was
                                        about a half dozen of them that went out to the various groups, not the least of
                                        which was my former university</div>

                                        we actually do. So we actually just got a couple of the original six that my
                                        company sold back in 2004. Here, with the idea of repurposing those for doing

                                        those pieces of equipment because the company, because my company, we ended up
                                        not succeeding in penetrating that market and ended up closing it down. We like
                                        literally that equipment's not built anymore. And so it was really kind of a
                                        cool opportunity to grab something that I know is capable and that we might be

                                        about the product and having a finished product that was ready to go. Now,
                                        frankly, with all of the we all today, it is so common for us to speak about
                                        MVP's <a href="#" class="footnote2-button" data-footnote2-identifier="2"

                                        and just getting it out in front of the customer and testing that with the
                                        customer and pulling forward as fast as you can and allowing an incomplete
                                        product to go to market with the idea that that informs what you might do for
                                        your complete product. We were very, very naive in that regard</div>

                                    <div class="message from">Yep, and I joke that in terms of the successes that we
                                        have, it's half joke, half like legit. I could probably recreate now in about
                                        six months what it took us three years to do before. And that's just because
                                        you're, I mean, the idea that your MVPing as fast as you can. And the other
                                        thing I don't think I really appreciated was the cost of humans. So the most
                                        expensive part of any... Especially startup is going to be the bright minds and
                                        the great people that you inspire. But you got to remember that I was like, in
                                        my case as a CEO, every single one of their paychecks, like their livelihood,
                                        rests on your ability to succeed in creating whatever this thing is you're
                                        doing. I don't I I definitely went into a startup not appreciating the weight of
                                        that on me. But then also just ultimately what that comes down to cash flow and
                                        that ultimately comes down to either sales or investment. And so I think I might
                                        say I we the group of there were three of us that were kind of at the core of
                                        the start of the company. We naively thought that building the product was the
                                        most important part of any startup, and it is important, but it is not the most
                                        important, the most important. I would actually argue at this point is making
                                        sure that you've got cash phone and enough runway to get yourself to the point
                                        where you can build the product

                                        my employees jobs elsewhere. We knew we knew we were running out of cash. Yeah,
                                        I mean, the next step that I did was I basically went to go get my Ph.D., and
                                        that was not planned. So I was actually liquidating all of the equipment that we
                                        had in our office. Everybody's gone. So everybody is is off starting new jobs
                                        and everything else. I'm literally there in the office, you know, tears
                                        streaming down my cheeks with, you know, sitting in the puddle of my field
                                        company. And I called up just a professor that I knew who had used our equipment
                                        in the past. And I said, I said, Hey, I'll make a hell of a deal today. You
                                        know, we've got this, this cool little crawler that I know you've used and you
                                        know, the legacy in terms of where it came from. I'll give it to you for and I
                                        think it was like, I'll give it to you for 50 percent what our normal list price
                                        would be. And she says, Well, let me, I need to go talk to the department chair.
                                        She says, I don't come out of my overhead budget and I need to make sure that
                                        equipment costs. I can do that or whatever. I'll call you back tomorrow and I
                                        was like, OK, and I didn't think another thing of it. You know, then probably
                                        sniffle a little, you know, went home and cried some more. And so came back the
                                        next day and she said, OK, she says, we'll take the robot, she says, but I'm
                                        going to want the ultimate warranty. And I was and I kind of looked to the phone
                                        and I'm like, What do you mean, the ultimate warranty? And she says, Well, I
                                        talked to the department chair and this is like, this is November. So she she's
                                        like, Why don't you come up? You can work in my lab. I'll I'll hire you on as a
                                        research assistant and with that research assistant position, you'll basically
                                        get a tuition waiver to go to your Ph.D.. Right. And so I quite literally just
                                        like looked around the office and was like, Well, I have nothing else going on.
                                        And I really did kind of jump into that opportunity with with no real clear
                                        understanding of whether I would actually finish my Ph.D.. It quite literally
                                        was I need to get out of this town. I need to get away from these robots. It was
                                        a pretty another kind of burnout kind of experience for me. And so the idea that
                                        I would go to Massachusetts, a place I literally never been before and work on
                                        whatever research. Was that I wanted to do under the auspices of the university,
                                        that actually sounded like a pretty good plan at that point. And so I wish it
                                        was more deliberate than that. I wish I could say that it was like. While the
                                        company failed and then I had a very clear picture as to what I wanted to
                                        contribute to the society in terms of, you know, technology through through the
                                        course of a Ph.D.. But that wasn't it at all. I just needed to get out of town.
                                        And a wonderful professor came in and said, Hey, I want you to come up and work
                                        and work in my lab</div>

                                        research back into sort of a managerial role. What made you decide that you
                                        wanted to go, you know, step away from the research for a bit and then go into
                                        sort of that project management space?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So being a program manager at DARPA, first of all, it's
                                        just honestly, it's such a privilege even to get the interview</div>

                                        not know it. So you feel free to give a little 101 of what DARPA does</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So the very brief version on DARPA. So its mission is to
                                        basically prevent and create surprise, strategic surprise. It was founded after
                                        <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/sputnik#:~:text=On%20October%204%2C%201957%2C%20the,accomplish%20this%20scientific%20advancement%20first."
                                            target=&quot;_blank&quot> Sputnik</a>. So when the Russians launched
                                        Sputnik, the US, especially the US
                                        intelligence and engineering community, was very surprised by the Russians
                                        ability to leapfrog ahead of the U.S. in terms of satellite technology. So DARPA
                                        was created to make sure that the U.S. was never in that position again. And
                                        part of DARPA's charter is to be disruptive, to question assumptions and to play
                                        forward in a very kind of almost aggressive way with regards to its use of
                                        technology and other things like that. You know, earlier in the story, I'd
                                        mentioned that the person who called us to go up to the trade center was our
                                        DARPA program manager. I remember very early on just being enamored by what
                                        appeared to be just like these godlike positions in which people got to come up
                                        with very broad, sweeping ideas and then have millions of government dollars and
                                        they go execute on those ideas. And so that was and that a lot of that was set
                                        in naivete. I actually didn't realize how hard it was as a program manager to
                                        succeed, but to put a cap on the 101. So basically, DARPA is jokingly referred
                                        to as the mad scientists of the Pentagon. So all of the stuff that the normal
                                        defenses would not come up with themselves. That's what DARPA's supposed to be
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">It's like the very bleeding edge</div>
                                    <div class="message from">And there's also a little bit of and making sure that we

                                        a we don't understand what this is or what physics could they be leveraging to
                                        allow them to do the following thing that we observed and DARPA ends up being
                                        kind of a consultant to the rest of the Department of Defense a lot of times in
                                        those regards</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And so what exactly was was your involvement within DARPA
                                        and what did you love about working at DARPA the most. And then if you're
                                        allowed to talk about it, potentially any of the most exciting projects that
                                        were under your program</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So involvement, I mean, I came in as a program manager.
                                        Usually when you come in, you're coming in with some specific skill or some
                                        specific domain that they're looking for. I was coming in strangely enough with
                                        ground robotics experience, and I think that was where they were wanting to put
                                        most of my efforts initially. And then there was a big push regarding drones. So
                                        I was there kind of on the ground floor of drones, really and quadcopters and
                                        hexacopters really coming into their maturity. And so very quickly, I was kind of
                                        repositioned into working a lot of UAV and drone type programs. Which was cool.
                                        It was way outside of my comfort zone</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Big drones we talking?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">All the sizes, everything from tiny, little like ones that
                                        are smaller than commercial drones that we could buy today, you know, all the
                                        way up to like, you know, <a
                                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-1_Predator"
                                            target=&quot;_blank&quot> Predator</a> and <a
                                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk"
                                            target=&quot;_blank&quot> Global Hawk</a>, like proper aircraft.
                                        So that was pretty exciting, and I had not especially worked in the larger
                                        aircraft domains before. And frankly, aside from working for NASA, I really
                                        aeronautics is in NASA's name. But I had not been formally trained in a lot of
                                        the aeronautics side of things or whatever. And so that's if there's anything
                                        you can say about DARPA it'll definitely push you way outside of your comfort
                                        zones, not only in terms of your ability to think big and to dramatically change
                                        things, but then to sometimes work outside of domains that you even feel
                                        confident in. And so, yeah, so we in terms of interesting programs that we ended
                                        up working, I mean, I'd say the one that was really inspiring was this program
                                        called fly as <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/fast-lightweight-autonomy"

                                        basically quadcopters or
                                        drones basically maneuvering indoors in an outdoor wooded type, situations at
                                        ridiculous speeds <a href="#" class="footnote-button"

                                    <div class="message to">What kind of speeds?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So north of 20 meters per second? And where the whole idea
                                        with 20 meters per second is, you know, with these things moving through the
                                        world that quickly, by the time you hear it or even have an opportunity for like
                                        it to catch it out of the corner of your eye by the time you've turned and
                                        looked to see where the aircraft is, it's already gone in around the next
                                        corner. And so there was an element kind of stealth and just a very hyper hyper
                                        agility in terms of its ability to move through the environment. We had had at
                                        that point there was some really great work coming out of the universities like
                                        the MIT and Stanford and University of Pennsylvania or U-PEN rather that were
                                        really demonstrating agile and fast moving aircraft. And so we wanted to just
                                        push that as fast as we could and see where it would go. So we actually that
                                        program ended after I had already departed DARPA. You're only allowed to stay at
                                        DARPA, usually about four years and most program managers leave around year
                                        three. That's kind of where your street value kind of maximizes</div>

                                    <div class="message from">I was there for three and some change. And yeah, and so
                                        long story short, it's my understanding that they achieved a lot of those
                                        original goals that we had in FLA and let's just say that and I haven't looked
                                        recently, but about every time I checked back, YouTube's got some other really
                                        cool video of some drone doing something stupid fast. Yeah, and a lot of those
                                        videos actually came out of the DARPA program that I started. Yeah, it that's

                                        robotics during 2013 to 2016. Was that a coincidence or did you play a part in
                                        in that? So just with your history with search and rescue and robotics</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So I was there. So no, I won't say I actually won't take
                                        credit for any of that. Yeah, I did help a lot. So the robotics challenge, there
                                        was a program manager that was the primary one that was kind of he was the one
                                        that was the center of the DRC. I actually, though, not surprisingly, helped a
                                        lot. So at the very least, my role was running the expo. So while most of the
                                        videos and everything else is of the robots that are actually inside of the
                                        stadium doing their thing, there was an entire exposition that was there at the
                                        L.A. civic center area or whatever. And so we had this huge area that was
                                        outside. And so I was kind of his it was never officially this, but I was kind
                                        of his deputy program manager. Yeah. And so while he was doing all of the
                                        important robotics work that was inside, I was kind of running everything else
                                        that was out in the. We kind of joked everything that was out in the parking
                                        lot, which it was a really big parking lot. But all of the exposition stuff or
                                        whatever that was mine. What's interesting, though, to me is that a lot of the
                                        successes and a lot of the real advancements that we saw in the DRC not, to my
                                        surprise, were captured or were created by a lot of the same organizations and
                                        universities and other things that I had been working with in the in the urban
                                        search and rescue world for many, many years prior. So seeing especially for the

                                        first, although people
                                        knew about it, that was its first like real premier. Like, OK, now the public
                                        seeing it really doing something <a href="#" class="footnote-button"

                                        Yeah. And then all of the rest of the CMUs and
                                        the Stanfords of the world getting out there and doing their thing. That was
                                        pretty rewarding</div>

                                        humanoid. Well, what do you think the reason for that was, I mean, like, we're
                                        seeing a lot more emphasis on legged robotics and stuff these days <a href="#"

                                        But in that
                                        DARPA challenge, most of the contestants were all humanoid robots. What did you
                                        think that was?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">It wasn't mandated, but there was a strong I will say that
                                        especially that program manager was kind of leading and biasing the field a
                                        little bit in terms of the the the work and the themes that they were trying to
                                        explore. The general theme for that one was, you know, we have lots of areas and
                                        lots of facilities that are designed for humans. So you know that valve or that
                                        gauge to read or the ability to pull the hose or do the whatever, whatever that
                                        activity is, it's probably designed for a human to do it</div>
                                    <div class="message to">It's the same problem we have at the moment on Woodside
                                        facilities</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly. Yeah. So the idea that you have a facility,
                                        whether that be a ship or a building that's collapsed or whatever, most of the
                                        apparatus that is there to to work with or to help remedy that situation is
                                        probably designed for humans. So there's a logic train here that says it would
                                        probably behoove you to have your robots take some type of human form so that it
                                        can take advantage of all of the things over there. So in the DRC, for instance,
                                        they required that the robot be able to drive a buggy. And that was because the
                                        idea, while you could from a ground up engineer, something that's got wheels can
                                        go kilometers downrange and then get out of itself, I guess. Or however, it was
                                        interfacing to the buggy and go do its thing. But chances are you're going to
                                        show up on site, you're going to have your robot and then you're going to have
                                        all of this equipment that was already there. And so the real challenge was, how
                                        do you use these things that are already there</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And already designed for people</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Well and maybe uniquely designed for that site. You got to
                                        remember this is also after Fukushima and some of the other disasters in which
                                        we knew like the idea that you have a robot that is prepared for nuclear,
                                        radiological, biological, chemical and that you can do that in fire. If you can
                                        do that full gamut with one piece of equipment that has everything that's
                                        needed, that that's a hell of an engineering task</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Oh, for sure. But to me, that seems harder than saying like,
                                        Okay, we can design a robot specifically for nuclear and a robot specifically for
                                        fire. You know what I mean?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yep or take the take the middle point there. And that's to
                                        say we're going to design something that would be human like in its ability to
                                        use all of the equipment that's already been specifically engineered for that
                                        environment. So all of the mitigation strategies that you would have, let's say,
                                        for nuclear, radiological, those are really bespoke and really freaking
                                        expensive things. So why not just design a robot that in fact may fail under
                                        those environments over longer periods of time because of radioactive effects
                                        and stuff like that? But you don't care. Right? Let the robot degrade. Let. It
                                        fell in place, but its ability to use the tools and the equipment that's on
                                        site, that becomes super valuable</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So you then made your return to NASA AMES to take the role

                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, I mean, I'll do the last, the last part of the
                                        question first. And that's to say the reason why you work at NASA is for the
                                        mission. So of all of all of the jobs I've ever had in my career, you know,
                                        figuring out how to help mankind do its thing in space. That's cool. I mean,
                                        that's the kind of stuff that'll get you up in the morning and make you want to
                                        run in and go do cool stuff. My job there, though, was more as the group lead.
                                        It was less engineering and more people wrangling. So I'd say that in terms of a
                                        lot of my leadership learnings and other things like that, I probably learned
                                        more during my tenure as the group lead at NASA</div>

                                        NASA with DARPA, you're trying to change the direction of a technical field. So
                                        it is technical in that you have to have a deep understanding or very quickly be
                                        able to develop a deep understanding of the thing that you're doing, but DARPA
                                        itself like there are no labs or, you know, soldering irons or anything inside
                                        of the walls of DARPA. Your job and you are chartered to change, one of the
                                        mantras that they use is you don't need to solve the problem, you need to change
                                        the way in which the field is talking about the problem</div>
                                    <div class="message to">You set the direction of the research</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yep. And so while it was technical, it was not about, you
                                        know, coding or creating hardware or anything else like that you were you were
                                        inspiring large groups of people to do that. At NASA though, while during my
                                        first tenure at NASA, that was very technical and that was this actually flying
                                        hardware that I had a hand in helping to build and create. So after doing DARPA,
                                        then going back to NASA during that second round, it was much more group
                                        management, group leadership and other things like that. So we, you know, for
                                        all of the, you know, at any given point, we were running a dozen different
                                        projects out of that group. And so it was how do you manage the people? How do
                                        you resources those projects? How do you make sure that in terms of, you know,
                                        time budgets, schedule and all the rest of that stuff that you're you're flying
                                        and kind of steering that ship correctly, that ended the kind of joke that I had
                                        coming out of that was I spent most of my career trying to figure out how to be
                                        a roboticist. And what I really feel like I should have done was gone and got a
                                        psychology degree. Because it ended up just more me handling and managing humans
                                        than I did with robotics</div>

                                    <div class="message from">So this is the predecessor to Astrobee. That's what I'd
                                        say, the most rewarding thing was I got to watch the full chain of events from I
                                        was on the ground floor of us figuring out how to upgrade spheres, to do some of
                                        the existence proofs that we needed to determine that an Astrobee like thing
                                        made sense</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Sorry if I ruined your punch line for that story haha</div>
                                    <div class="message from">No, no, not at all. And so we so we flew like in that
                                        case, we flew the first smartphone that ever went to space, and we use that
                                        smartphone to interface to the sphere. And that's how we were doing all of our
                                        compute and kind of the command and control aspect of it. Yeah, awesome. Then
                                        after we flew that, that then allowed us to make a very convincing argument to
                                        NASA headquarters, basically saying we actually believe that free fliers could
                                        have an almost like a first class citizenship on the International Space Station
                                        during the first helping astronauts, because the idea that it's there as a
                                        personal flying personal assistant to the astronaut is the first use case. And
                                        then the second, there's actually three use cases. The second use case is the
                                        ability for the astronaut to use the Astrobee in a remote, controllable remote
                                        operations kind of mode. So they are in one module and they are using the
                                        Astrobee to do something and another module and then the final one, and it ended
                                        up being the one I think that NASA was most interested in by the time we were
                                        done was the idea that ground controllers so folks in mission control or even
                                        outside of Mission control would be able to kind of check out a Astrobee and to
                                        go fly. One of the toughest, strangely enough, one of the toughest things that
                                        the International Space Station deals with operationally is positioning and
                                        getting cameras where you need it so you can see the thing you need to look at.
                                        And so even just the idea of this being a free flying camera that can go around,
                                        that was kind of our MVP, one of our MVPs that we were working. And and I'll
                                        just say it was actually pretty wonderful to be there and especially to be
                                        working as the as the group lead when Astrobee actually was able to fly. And I
                                        watched those successes and kind of being the command center, when all of those
                                        like things happened and you're watching the astronauts celebrating the thing
                                        that you've spent the last five years of your life building</div>

                                        an epiphany that I then, after thinking about it shared. Let's just say NASA,
                                        while externally is amazing, and the mission is just something that you can
                                        absolutely gobble up that I'll just say working for the U.S. government under
                                        the Trump administration was a little more difficult than I certainly was having
                                        an easy time bearing. But then also on top of all of that, I think there was
                                        this epiphany that we're frankly destroying the planet faster than we might be
                                        able to get off of it. Hmm. So if our ability to work on other planets or to be
                                        kind of a a species that can survive off this, you know, fragile little planet
                                        that we're on, that if you if you look at it and measure your career in you
                                        maximizing the impact that you can make to society or to the world or whatever.
                                        Jason had the epiphany, and then I later shared the epiphany that I could do
                                        more good for humanity by figuring out how to capture and us to be able to use
                                        new energy and <a
                                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxjNhLZCae0&ab_channel=Freethink"
                                            target=&quot;_blank&quot> Carbon Capture</a> and other things like that. And
                                        so I very much
                                        with Woodside being so forward leaning in terms of its want to do <a
                                            href="https://www.woodside.com.au/what-we-do/hydrogen"
                                            target=&quot;_blank&quot> New Energy</a> and
                                        other things like that. It occurred to me that I could frankly have more impact
                                        trying to achieve that while and I guess the part that I was OK with was I knew
                                        that there was this amazing team that I had the pleasure of supporting as the
                                        group lead for, you know, the years that I was there. I knew that I could step
                                        aside and this amazing space robotics thing would continue. And so, yeah, so
                                        that was the flip over to to to the oil and gas side. The running joke is that,
                                        you know, we're trying to figure out how to make robots work in oil and gas,
                                        such that when new energy is ready for us, then it's just a matter of switching
                                        the domain. Right now, oil and gas is paying the bills. And with all of the
                                        initiatives that Woodside has in terms of its clean energy or whatever. I feel
                                        confident that we're going to get to a place in which robots are really
                                        contributing to the new energy side</div>

                                        were doing the same thing where it was like astronauts have human shaped tools
                                        or tools that are shaped for humans to use. And so robots should have that. And
                                        we were on the other side of that engineering coin. That was to say, Well, now
                                        actually, you should optimize the shape of your robot for the application. Don't
                                        be constrained to what evolution has provided us in terms of, you know, bodily
                                        form. We can, you know, go someplace else with this. And so I'm on the other
                                        side of the coin now. And that's to say, our ability to work with NASA plays
                                        well into the ability for these robots to like, let's say, be on offshore assets
                                        and other things like that. So that's so that's the NASA arrangement. We're

                                        robot and what will hopefully be maybe future versions of robots like that are
                                        ones that have kind of been in my life for a while, and I'm excited to get

                                        the next big step change for these capabilities? So something that hasn't sort
                                        of happened yet or is maybe on the periphery like, what do you think it will
                                        take like for for robotics in those fields to sort of take that next leap?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I'm going to answer the question, probably not the way you
                                        want. I actually don't know, at least in my experience, that leaps are the way
                                        that solutions like that are created. I actually think it's really slow, almost
                                        painful, just diligence. You know, as I look like now we have robots today that
                                        do especially like an industrial inspection and other things like that in EX
                                        rated environments, which is to say, environments in which things may explode.
                                        It took decades before we were able to inch forward in terms of those kinds of
                                        technologies. NASA's another one, although although it is pretty frickin
                                        grandiose when the when the rocket launches off the pad and the thing goes to
                                        the station and and the robot does whatever it's going to do the path of getting
                                        to that success, everybody remembers that like crashing through the finish line
                                        and it all being awesome. What they don't usually see is the half decade prior
                                        of just slow and gradual grinding to get yourself there</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So yeah, well, I guess understanding it won't be an
                                        instantaneous leap, but if there's like a problem that you could look at, and be
                                        like you know what? Once that solved, like I think things will take off. You
                                        know, what I mean? I'm going to try and corner you into this</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So it's a good question. And frankly, it was. So the real
                                        trick here is, if you know the answer to this question, you should probably just
                                        go get it done. I mean, I know so one of the biggest, one of the largest
                                        barriers that I see and it's been a theme throughout my career and it was a
                                        theme that we were definitely trying to figure out, like with the fast
                                        lightweight autonomy program that I was talking about before. I'll say as a as a
                                        roboticists and as somebody who's like works on and has has worked on making
                                        robots do things you always feel like you're starved for information or starved
                                        for a representation of the world that allows you to do decision making or
                                        allows the system to adaptively decide what it's going to do next</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Which is like huge in the machine learning space right now
                                        in terms of like being able to you know, go from image feeds and actually create
                                        like a latent variable space that is easy to create actions from</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yep. And so what does that knowledge representation look
                                        like with the sensors that are feeding that? Yeah. If you're leveraging neural
                                        nets or machine learning or whatever, what does the back end of the learning
                                        process look like?</div>
                                    <div class="message to">It's something we do really well as in humans do really well
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah, because we had to, we had to learn to adapt well. So
                                        we've had millions of years worth of evolution that has allowed us to converge
                                        on what for us ends up being a pretty decent existence in which we have to be
                                        smart. We have to sense things. We have to keep the tigers from eating us and
                                        the plains of Africa. We managed to do all of those things fairly well. I would
                                        argue that like right now for robotics, we're still not very good at having a
                                        robot survive. You know, like in that case, being eaten like the evolution in
                                        the if it dies, it doesn't get to procreate. That ends up being a really great
                                        focusing or limiting function in terms of what the positive outcomes are that
                                        you're seeking. With robotics we don't have that. We don't have the privilege of
                                        just eating every robot that doesn't do what we want it to do. Now that's where
                                        machine learning and neural nets and everything else try to leverage on the
                                        software side. To me, it's whats kind of interesting, though, is like, I still
                                        feel like the systems that we're building are still starved for the really rich
                                        information that we get through our eyes and through our smells and through all
                                        of the senses that we have as humans. The roboticists in me still wants to like
                                        shake my fist at the cloud and go, we need better sensors, I now, you know, with
                                        too much gray in my beard realize that's not the answer but I think that our
                                        ability to not only have really great sensors and then really great ways of
                                        capturing that into like knowledge representation that allows us to process that
                                        thing intelligently and adaptively. That would be the next big step if we could
                                        just achieve that in one swoop. Yeah, that would actually be a really, really
                                        great improvement to the systems we're building</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Well, I remember there was a I think it was out in NEURIPS a

                                        He basically proclaimed to the whole research community that the
                                        robotics hardware has been good enough for a while now. The limiting factor is
                                        software and in particular as we were talking about, knowledge representation
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">I think the pendulum swings. I would say, like right now,
                                        if so, for those researchers that, let's say, 10 years ago were struggling to
                                        have a bipedal robot walk across the room, the hardware and the software, that's
                                        the control software for that has caught up. Now what hasn't caught up is, OK,
                                        that robot just walked across the room. What's it deciding to do next? The
                                        higher level goal and the kind of the deliberative-ness in which humans walk
                                        around the world and find things to go or do and solve. That's the part that we
                                        don't have in robotics right now. So even in the last decade, we're dramatically
                                        further than I think those previous robotics folks would have imagined that we
                                        would actually just have a commercially available. The idea that you
                                        commercially can just go buy a spot is mind blowing to roboticists like me that
                                        grew up in the late 90s, early 2000s, in which it was a wheel platform that
                                        looked like a garbage can like, you know, had three wheels. And we were lucky if
                                        we could get across the lab and not, you know, strike anybody or a piece of
                                        furniture</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah, the first time I flew over that just to walk into the

                                        was pretty epic. So we're kind of moving into the fun questions now. So
                                        actually, maybe this one is not that fun but the next ones are fun I promise.

                                    <div class="message from">But I wish I could go back and like if I could take the
                                        experience that I have now. And what at least right now, like, I don't worry, I
                                        have a lot less anxiety with regards to what I'm going to go do next. Yeah. And
                                        again, I've had some wonderful and fortunate positive reinforcement data points
                                        that have allowed me to of hit this place. But that's to say, you know, you're
                                        you're not going to have like, I wish I could go back and tell myself, you're
                                        not going to have a problem finding employment if you keep with the passion and
                                        the drive and the interest that you have in the things that you're doing now.
                                        Stop worrying about whether you're going to be able to pay rent or have food.
                                        Yeah. And truth be told, there were moments in which that was actually a pretty
                                        decent concern, especially when we were doing the startup. Yeah, it was like, I
                                        literally don't have a paycheck this month and I have no sales in the pipeline
                                        and I might not be able to have a roof over my head next month. And the trick
                                        there is there's a little bit of luck, but there's just a lot of being prepared
                                        into keeping yourself moving forward. I wish I could have. I wish I could go
                                        back in time and just instill a little bit more of that in me</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah, it's going to be fine just say as it's going to be

                                        really, really, really bad, you're going to work yourself out of that. That's
                                        not what I wouldn't go back in time is go back and say, don't worry about it.
                                        It'll be easy, like you're going to work your ass off. But the idea that you're

                                        things that bring you joy again, it has been a fortunate walk. It's like I've
                                        found that if I concentrate on those things that are almost always lead me to

                                        life the most, hopefully positively. Is the one that comes to mind?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">It's kind of a series, it's funny, though, as you said
                                        that though the one and I think it was maybe an epiphany of perspective is what
                                        the professor was giving me when I was doing my masters, on the World Trade
                                        Center. There was a lot of kind of decision making and other things that I
                                        needed to work out, and that experience wasn't ending up where I needed it to be
                                        in terms of concluding that work such that I could go forth and do other things.
                                        And that professor kind of sat me down and he said, Mark, he's like, Look, it's
                                        look on the inside of the cover page. This thesis, it says, for the partial
                                        fulfillment of the degree requirements. That's it. This is not your life's work.
                                        And at that point in my career, I and I remember almost being, like, almost
                                        adamantly disagreeable with him to say, No, this is my life's work. This is what
                                        I'm here to do. This everything. I'm literally saving people in rubble piles.
                                        How dare you say that this is not my life's work? What he was giving me was a
                                        glimpse of perspective and that even if you can't have something, be what if
                                        that moment you believe is your life's work? Yeah, but he was right. And that I
                                        would then later go on to do a startup and to go to NASA. NASA has very little
                                        to do with what I was doing for the other thing there with the World Trade
                                        Center stuff or whatever. And so it is, I would say, that's probably what I
                                        think I earned, maybe there in terms of his bestowing upon me, that knowledge
                                        was just the idea that in any given moment, no matter how good or bad or
                                        otherwise you are doing in your career, that's just that moment of time. Yeah.
                                        And what you're doing and the thing that you're stressing out about is probably
                                        just a partial fulfillment of whatever it is that you're actually going to do in
                                        your career</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah, it's just one chapter of the total book</div>
                                    <div class="message from">And what's amazing for me is that he said that almost like
                                        he was trying to be helpful. But he said that with a wisdom that I knew he had
                                        earned that understanding and I hadn't. And so now I can look back and what's
                                        interesting is that Professor is now, you know, I don't think we've actually

                                    <div class="message from">This will sound like I'm being hyperbolic when I say it,
                                        but I actually truly believe that technology is the only way we're going to get
                                        ourselves out of the crisis that we have right now. It's weird to say I'm
                                        excited about solving the fact that we're about to destroy the rock we live on.
                                        But I actually think that it will be when we get on the other side of solving
                                        those problems, and I do believe we're going to solve those problems with
                                        technology. I don't believe it lies in policy. I don't believe it lies in like
                                        the idea that we globalize the way that let's, let's say, the western world's
                                        lived today. If that globalises, then we destroy this entire planet. The only
                                        thing I think that breaks a lot of those cycles is our ability to leverage
                                        technology to lessen those effects. And so whether that be autonomous cars or
                                        robots or carbon capture or, you know, finding ways of doing more efficient
                                        hydrogen production, all of that to me, is lumped into the same technology
                                        advancement for us as a species. And that's what I'm excited about. Otherwise,
                                        the alternative is pretty frickin dystopian, and I really, at least in my little
                                        humble opinion, I think it's technology that actually saves us from that</div>

                                    <div class="message from">With a lot of that, and of course, you know, we're doing a
                                        lot of this work here, if we are able to sequester carbon, that's huge. That
                                        actually takes so much weight at that point. We can actually use heavy fuels,
                                        fossil fuels, hydrogen, wind, whatever. And it doesn't actually matter because
                                        we're able to remove the carbon, which is, you know, one of the biggest
                                        catalysts for us having issues now. So if that existed, I mean, that's huge that
                                        that is such an enabler on so many different levels. The effects of that I
                                        don't know that you could even really measure them well, that would just be a

                                        exactly what we're doing here. What I'm eager to do is to get us a little bit
                                        further ahead in that exploration so that we actually know like so a lot of the

                                        things like that, we don't necessarily know how to scale it. The idea that as we
                                        start the needle starts moving much, much more toward the D, which is to say,
                                        OK, we know what to do, and now we just need to do it at scale. I would love to

                                        was many of us that could see the world that we now live in in terms of there
                                        being monetization strategies that make cyber criminals very aggressive in their
                                        techniques and the idea of nation state level hacking efforts and other stuff
                                        like that. There was a lot of us that we're seeing that back in the 90s and
                                        early 2000s, I tapped out because I was burned out. And so it's one of those
                                        where there's a whole cohort of my friends that have that have stayed in that.
                                        And I can now say with a little bit of a grin on my face being, you know, fully
                                        entrenched in robotics or whatever. I think I would have been pretty good if I
                                        would have stayed in that career path. The other, the other career path that I
                                        probably there's a parallel universe in which Mark is just driving an 18
                                        wheeler, just a truck across probably the U.S. and that's one of those things
                                        where I don't so I don't have any problem, just kind of sitting in my own head
                                        and working out problems and other things. And I've always loved especially open
                                        road driving. And so it's weird to say, you know, I either would be wanting to
                                        sit on the bleeding edge of cyber response or just sitting behind the wheel of
                                        an 18 wheeler</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So it's funny because the path you picked is probably going
                                        to be the field that makes driving the truck on the long road redundant right?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Hahah thats right, So it's my evil plan. Yeah, if I can't
                                        be a trucker, nobody will</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah hahah. If you retire today or let's say tomorrow, what
                                        aspect of your career would you be most proud of?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">It's funny, I think because space stuff was so ingrained in
                                        my childhood, so growing up in South Florida, where I can remember, like
                                        literally being single digit years old and us going out onto the roof of the
                                        school to watch the shuttle launch. You know, in South Florida, you can do that.
                                        And that seemed at the time, working for or being just in the orbit of NASA just
                                        seems so just impossible. Like just who who is able to do that. And so I'm proud
                                        of the ability to have gone and done that. But again, just the accidental nature
                                        of like my ability to have contributed the World Trade Center and to have
                                        contributed in multiple disasters in which we were trying to inch forward on
                                        robots being able to contribute to search and rescue whatever that was... So
                                        strangely enough, I consider that more of an uphill battle and more of a
                                        struggle than what it took for me to work in and to be successful at NASA. It's
                                        hard when you're trying to make markets that don't exist in a market that
                                        doesn't necessarily want what you're building. Yeah, that's a little different
                                        from NASA, which was desperately trying to find technology to allow us to
                                        succeed in the things that we were doing. It's a different mode of operation
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">So if you could interview anyone in the same way that I just
                                        interviewed you, who would be?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Oh that's a good question. Probably so, one of my mentors.
                                        And he was the original program manager, and he's somebody that I know very,
                                        very well. But I find that every time I sit down and have a beer with him or
                                        whatever, I find some other story that I had no idea even existed. His name is
                                        John Blitch. I realize I should be answering like Gandhi or Elon Musk or, you
                                        know, somebody who would show up on Joe Rogan next week. And in fact, I would
                                        love to you know, maybe have the opportunity to do an interview like this with
                                        some of my mentors because at least in two cases of really, really great mentors
                                        I've had. What I found with both of them is for whatever depth it is you think
                                        you know about that person, there's more down below it. And what I find is that
                                        the deeper you go, sometimes the more profound the lessons are and the better

                                        watch the movie its horrible. But the book is the
                                        world from the perspective of a golden retriever. And of course, it also it's
                                        also based around he is that he is the pet dog of a race car driver. He was
                                        going through a whole bunch of turmoil in his life and other things like that.
                                        And one seeing the world through the eyes of a dog. The author does an amazing
                                        job of taking you along for that journey. Yeah, I've joked, you know how they
                                        have different personality types and you're able to like attach personality
                                        types to dog types or whatever. Actually, in everyone I've ever done, I've
                                        always come out as the golden retriever. So it's not by accident that I think
                                        for me, that book resonated with me so strongly. It's not a complex book, and I
                                        don't know if its one that you walk out of the end of that book going wow I have
                                        accumulated the following three life lessons that will leave me well. But it's
                                        one that I would say that. So the two that I pick up the most often I've reread
                                        the art of racing in the rain god, probably four or five times. The other one is

                                        is the term meta-verse comes from snow crash. And while I will admit so, Neal
                                        Stephenson is an interesting science fiction author, at that stage in his
                                        career, he was notorious for not finishing books well, the books would kind of

                                        inspired, I will pick up snow crash and read the first two chapters. And it is
                                        like this obnoxious, over-the-top Michael Bay style trailer of what the future

                        </section>

                        <p>Here are my key takeaways from the podcast.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Worry less about what is next</b> - Mark said that he wishes that when he was
                                younger that he worried less about what would he would be doing next and if he have
                                problems finding employment. Focus that energy instead on keeping with your passion,
                                interests and drive for the things that you're doing right now. It's going to be fine
                                and even when it's even when it's really, really bad, you're going to work yourself out
                                of that.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Chase your smile</b> - Mark's number one mantra has been to chase your smile. He
                                believes that is the key thing that has led him to his successes to date. This is also
                                what drives him when it comes to learning and sharpening new skills, follow what is
                                drawing you and makes you passionate and excited.
                            </li>

                            <li> <b>Your life won't be defined by a single chunk of work</b> - In the past Mark himself
                                has fallen victim to thinking that the what he was doing at the time defined him and his
                                career. With hindsight he now knows that each chapter of your career and life is exactly
                                that and however bad and well that is going, you will always have new and exciting
                                future challenges to add more chapters to your book.
