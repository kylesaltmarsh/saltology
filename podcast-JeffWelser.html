                        <h1>Dr. Jeff Welser &mdash; Vice President and Lab Director, IBM Research Almaden</h1>


                        <p>I had the pleasure of kicking off THINK 2019 by meeting with Dr. Jeffrey
                            Welser, Vice President and Lab Director, IBM Research - Almaden. I met Jeff right in the
                            heart of THINK! So you will be able to hear the buzz of the conference as we talk about
                            Jeff's hobbies, his career, the future of IBM research, quantum computing and more! Jeff was
                            an awesome guy - so accomplished but very down to earth, relate-able and easy to talk to -
                            exactly the kind of guy that I am sure the IBM research team would love to work with and
                            follow. Enjoy the podcast!</p>

                            notes. I have also included some of the raw speech-to-text bloopers which are by far greater
                            than the real content itself. These footnotes are slightly more boring <a href="#"

                                        favourite movie, your favourite food and your favourite hobby just to kick
                                        things off?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So I'll start with my favourite hobby which is actually
                                        cooking. I love to cook, it is by far my favourite thing</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Well that works well with your favourite food</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly. For foods I love sushi in general but if i’m
                                        cooking something I really like to make braised meats, like a piece of beef or a
                                        piece of pork and cook them for for hours and hours in the stove with a really
                                        thick sauce, oh that's great. And favourite movie, favourite movie. Well my
                                        favourite classic movie is probably <a

                                        that I have enjoyed recently, well I have to say I watch a lot of kids movies
                                        right now because my son is 10 years old, so I'm deep in the middle of the
                                        Marvel Heroes series which are hardly arts films but they are kind of fun</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Awesome awesome. So you went to Stanford University and did
                                        electrical engineering at your bachelor?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yes that's right</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And you decided that wasn't enough and that you wanted to do
                                        your masters in electrical engineering?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yep haha</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Aand that still didn't satisfy you and so you decided you
                                        wanted to do your PhD</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Haha correct</div>
                                    <div class="message to">So looking back on your younger self, what made you decide
                                        to wanted to do a PhD and did you know at that age that research was what you
                                        wanted to go into?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">So I think two things. First of all actually, growing up
                                        like my father was a professor. My mom also taught at a university. So everyone
                                        I knew around me had PhDs. I lived in a very educated area, everyone had at
                                        least a masters</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Right so it was like an arms race</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah exactly I always joke my father “it wasn't until I
                                        got to college that I realised I didn't have to go, I thought I had to”. So I
                                        got to college, I really was really going to computer science and programming
                                        but I really got interested in the hardware the physics side of the world. Yeah.
                                        So starting an engineering and when I finished the bachelor I realised I wanted
                                        to get at least a masters because I really wanted to get into some of the
                                        material stuff and that that point I got into the PhD program but took a year
                                        off and went worked for IBM.<a href="#" class="footnote-button"
                                            data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote"
                                            data-footnote-content="<p> <b>Speech-To-Text Blooper</b> <br>  Officially the batches I don't want to get at least a masters because I could really get into some material stuff I want to do. Yeah. And at that point I actually I got into the KFC program. It took a year off and went worked for IBM from there</p>"><span>2</span></a>
                                        There was a guy there who liked to take in students when they're somewhere in
                                        the graduate program</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Like an internship?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Sort of but it was a year long so it was sort of like a
                                        postdoc but like, before you're a doc. Right. So did a year at Yorktown Heights
                                        and really loved doing research. Thought it was great so yeah that solidified
                                        it, go back to school, get the PhD</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And that ticked that box that you wanted to go into research
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly, although interestingly though when I finished the
                                        PhD I was kind of on the edge about going into research at someplace like AT&T
                                        Bell Labs or IBM, like an industrial research lab or going to be a professor
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah traditional sort of research</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly so I was kinda on the edge and one of the things
                                        that drew me to IBM was when I started there in 95 they let me also teach at
                                        Columbia University for a couple of years. So I like to kind of test the waters
                                        for a while before I decide on something</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Yeah so that allowed you to balance both of your desires
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly. I realised that I loved and still love working
                                        with students, I get to continue to work a lot with universities, but I liked
                                        doing the industrial side of research</div>

                                        see that I would be an IBM this long. I had the idea it would be for a few years
                                        and then I would try a new job but I kept finding new opportunities, actually
                                        one of the things I always encourage people at IBM to do is that there are so
                                        many different things you can do at this company. So for me I was a researcher I
                                        loved it. After about four or five years I started managing the group which I
                                        also enjoyed and I realised I liked being a manager as I could see more of the
                                        research rather than just my little slice</div>
                                    <div class="message to">What was your slice?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">I was a device to device person so I focused on how you
                                        create the next generation Moore's Law chips, new materials, new device
                                        structures. So a lot of physics and fabrication in the lab</div>
                                    <div class="message to">I suppose there is a big overlap between the electrical
                                        engineering and the physics</div>
                                    <div class="message from">That's exactly right. Actually my group in grad school was
                                        applied physics and half electrical engineering. So I like that part, like doing
                                        the management and then I started talking to my managers about the fact that I
                                        thought I might want to go for more of a managerial track rather than a
                                        technical track</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And that was just to continue to have that overview?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Yeah. I like the breadth. I like being able to get lots of
                                        different things even rather than just doing my one thing. So I got an
                                        opportunity actually be a technical assistance to one of our general managers at
                                        the time. John Kelly who's now a senior V.P. He was at the time the general
                                        manager for the micro electronics division, the chip division. So I spent a year
                                        shadowing him and that was a great role to help me understand, you know, what
                                        the real business of IBM is about. I was amazed at how they don’t really spend
                                        much time with the technology they assume the technology and are like - How are
                                        you gonna market? Who are your partners going to be? Who are your clients going
                                        to be? Understanding all of that was really cool</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Shadowing, that’s interesting you brought that up because
                                        back in Australia New Zealand there is discussions going on about changing the
                                        graduate program to include shadowing opportunities for the graduates. How would
                                        you describe it, was that one of your most pivotal experiences do you think
                                        along your journey?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Absolutely, because it really has in many ways. First of
                                        all it solidified my mind that I do like idea of going into management but also
                                        realise that I really had to think more suddenly about what is managing? what do
                                        I actually want to do? There’s development and consulting and lots of areas to
                                        go into. Yes so I think that a T.A. position is great. Tends to be a full year
                                        so it a lot of commitment to your career. Yeah I think just seeing with like a
                                        week or two of shadowing would be helpful to get some ideas on things. So from
                                        there I went back and did a management development so I got out of research for
                                        a while and I enjoyed that, it was a great experience. I do highly recommend
                                        getting out of your division, try other divisions of IBM at some point because
                                        you get a better view</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And just to keep things interesting</div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly exactly. And then I came back into research. I
                                        spent several years actually in a role where I was managing a consortium of
                                        companies, with IBM being one of them of course, that funded university research
                                        on electronics. So I got a lot of time there working with university professors,
                                        working with executives of other companies that we can be pleased are our
                                        competitors like Intel, etc and then also the government, trying to get funding
                                        from the government to fund universities to do work that we thought was
                                        interesting. It was a very different experience. I loved it. That was really
                                        interesting for me. I actually then moved out of my comfort zone yet again to
                                        start managing software, which was not my area. That was I was a director so I
                                        would say that was an interesting challenge because I'd always been used to
                                        being in the area that I knew really well, so when I talk to my employees I knew
                                        that area very deeply. I don’t know software. I can program but i’m not a
                                        software guy. So it was very interesting, how do you manage a team when these
                                        guys all have PhDs and are all these experts in their field. How do you manage
                                        them and really help them if you can't actually help them technically?</div>
                                    <div class="message to">When you do when you're at the depth that they might have
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly. So really its much more than about strategy and
                                        figuring out your resources and how to allocate those resources</div>
                                    <div class="message to">And trust?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">And trust, a lot of trust. Also getting better about
                                        understanding when people are talking to you, if you do not understand the
                                        details, when something needs to be poked down a bit maybe. Is that really going
                                        that well? or are we having some trouble here? So you kind of learn that skill.
                                        But I think mostly it's about hiring good people, watching for results and
                                        trusting that you get good results</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Awesome and then that led you into your role today then?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="message from">Exactly. I did that and then in 2013 I moved from that
                                        role and took my old boss’s role to take over the lab</div>
                                    <div class="message to">What's that like?</div>
                                    <div class="message from">That is the best job in IBM. I think running a research
                                        lab, particularly one of the big labs like Zurich, Haifa, Almaden, the ones that
                                        are a fairly large and somewhat independent is great. The lab is a good size,
                                        I've got about 300 researchers so it's big enough we can really do cool things,
                                        but it's also small enough you really feel like a family and you get to know
                                        everybody and interact with them. So yeah it's a fantastic, and the breadth of
                                        stuff we do. We've got material science, which is my area, there are guys in the
                                        basement who literally move individual atoms around to create materials and
                                        structures. It's just fascinating. We’ve got a lot of work on quantum computing,
                                        polymer chemistry, hardcore science for the future chips that we do. And then
                                        there’s software and AI, storage system software like scale storage and cloud.
                                        We do a lot of work in medical imaging, and health in general, a lot of
                                        healthcare work. Also natural language processing, like the stuff that goes into

                                            target=&quot;_blank&quot>Project Debater</a> although we weren't really big
                                        in the debater part itself, but some of the underlying technologies we work on.
                                        So yeah it's a great lab</div>
                                    <div class="message to">Awesome, you stole the next question</div>

                                    <div class="message to">There's so much exciting stuff going on in that lab and then
                                        even beyond that, globally as well. Is there any particular field that
                                        fascinates you right now?</div>

                                            target=&quot;_blank&quot>Quantum computing</a> is by far the most
                                        fascinating thing that is going on in technology today, hands down. Even just
                                        the actual hardware I appreciate as well because it's very complicated, but
                                        putting that aside, just the software and the programming paradigm is so
                                        different than anything we've ever seen before. And it combines so many
                                        different fields of math and physics. We also need software developers, hardcore
                                        software developers who are willing to learn enough about quantum so we can
                                        start to apply it in new areas. So I think you know if I were starting my
                                        career, if it were 1995 again I would be spending a lot of my time focussing on
                                        quantum, I think it is really interesting</div>

                                <div class="message to">So in the lab do you guys have the coolers?</div>

                                    silicon which became a basis for a lot of what we do for our computer chips today.
                                    So just from a technical standpoint I was really proud of being able to be part of
                                    that time. Yeah but if I think about my career afterwards…</div>
                                <div class="message to">And you may have already achieved it</div>
                                <div class="message from">Haha well I think, well I hope that I will be able to identify
                                    those things we could have real impact and fostering and growing them. Because once
                                    you go into management you aren’t ding it yourself anymore. But I want to be able to
                                    look back and say wow, you know it was because I said let's go do this</div>
                                <div class="message to">That you picked the right things to pursue</div>
                                <div class="message from">Right and I don’t know which one of those it’s going to be
                                    yet, which ones are going to be the ones that I remember the fondest, but thats what
                                    I hope to look back on</div>
                                <div class="message to">Awesome. Is there anything that you wish you'd known when
                                    started out, if you could go back and talk to a younger version of yourself, what
                                    would it be?</div>
                                <div class="message from">Yeah. I would have I would told myself to stick with the
                                    programming and computer science longer. I would never change my actual major and
                                    where I did it, but when I got into electrical engineering I kinda just got enough
                                    programming under my belt to be able to use it. I don't think I realised, or any of
                                    us did in the late 80s early 90s, how all-pervasive software would become to
                                    everything we do. So now I mean obviously Ive picked up Python, Java and I can pick
                                    up some things along the way but I wish I'd stuck with that longer. I would say for
                                    people today, no matter what you are you going into, make sure you learn software
                                </div>

                            <h1 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">💡 Key Messages</h1>
                        </section>

                        <p>Here are my key takeaways from the podcast.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Stick to one thing for a part of your life and do it well</b> - A part of what has
                                led to Jeff's success is that he stuck to something - in this case electrical
                                engineering - and did it very well for a big part of his life. From there that opened up
                                the opportunities to move into management but that depth of knowledge and experience is
                                something that he draws on all the time</li>
                            <li> <b>Seek Shadowing opportunities</b> - One of the pivotal points in Jeff's career and
                                development was shadowing someone in a position that he was looking to move into for a
                                full year. Jeff said the experience was amazing and opened his eyes to so much more of
                                the business and strongly suggests that people seek shadowing opportunities, even if it
                                is just for a week or two</li>
                            <li> <b>Make your preferences known</b> - Jeff stated that once he realised he wanted to go
                                down the managerial track that he let his bosses know. It may sound simple but it is
                                extremely important to make your aspirations and preferences known to those around you
                                so that they can help foster your growth</li>
                            <li> <b>Everybody should learn software</b> - Software is all-pervasive and Jeff believes
                                that everybody, no matter who you are or what your role is, should start to develop an
                                understanding of programming and software</li>
                            <li> <b>Jeff can't wait for self driving cars</b> - So when he's - to use his words - 'old
                                and senile', he can still get from A to B</li>
                            <li> <b>Read <a
                                        href="https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567"
                                        target=&quot;_blank&quot> <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach</i></a></b> - A book about
                                human intelligence and consciousness by a mathematician, artist and a musician</li>
                        </ul>

                                future nanoscale logic devices to replace the CMOS transistor in the 2020 timeframe.
                                Before taking his current role, he was the Director of IBM's Accelerated Discovery Lab
                                and Services Research group, managing research into improved business processes,
                                software, and technology to enable IBM's Global Services divisions. Jeff is a member of
